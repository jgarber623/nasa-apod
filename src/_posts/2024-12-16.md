This kilometer high cliff occurs on the surface of a comet. It was discovered on the dark nucleus of [Comet Churyumov - Gerasimenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko) (CG) by [Rosetta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_\(spacecraft\)), a robotic spacecraft [launched](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap091123.html) by [ESA](http://www.esa.int/), which orbited the comet from 2014 to 2016. The ragged cliff, as [featured](http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/12/Comet_on_10_December_2014_NavCam) [here](https://cumbriansky.wordpress.com/2014/12/17/the-cliffs-of-churyumov-gerasimenko/), was imaged by Rosetta early in its mission. Although towering about one kilometer high, the low surface gravity of [Comet CG](http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2014/12/15/cometwatch-10-december/) would likely make a [jump](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140210.html) from the [cliffs](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110404.html) by a human survivable. At the foot of the cliffs is relatively smooth terrain dotted with [boulders](http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2014/10/09/boulder-close-up/) as large as 20 meters across. Data from [Rosetta](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/farewell-rosetta-esa-mission-to-end-on-comet-surface/) indicates that the ice in Comet CG has a significantly different [deuterium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium) fraction -- and hence likely a [different origin](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Rosetta_fuels_debate_on_origin_of_Earth_s_oceans) -- than the water in Earth's oceans. The probe was named after the [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone), a rock slab featuring the same text written in three different languages that helped humanity [decipher](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/00/84/ce/0084ce9d4e75ac0725816da10f42c2f8.jpg) ancient Egyptian writing.
