Why is Phobos so dark? [Phobos](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/mars-moons/phobos/in-depth/), the largest and innermost of the two Martian moons, is the darkest moon in the entire [Solar System](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/overview/). Its unusual orbit and color indicate that it may be a captured [asteroid](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/overview/) composed of a mixture of ice and dark rock. The [featured assigned-color picture](https://www.flickr.com/photos/192271236@N03/53063793187/in/pool-apods/) of Phobos near the edge of [Mars](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/) was captured in late 2021 by [ESA](https://www.esa.int/)'s robot spacecraft [Mars Express](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express), currently orbiting Mars. [Phobos](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080414.html) is a heavily cratered and [barren](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031109.html) moon, with its [largest crater](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230708.html) located on the far side. From images like this, [Phobos](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061203.html) has been determined to be covered by perhaps a meter of [loose dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap980914.html). Phobos [orbits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rxqZcO-0uI) so close to Mars that from some places it would appear to rise and set twice a day, while from other places it would [not be visible](https://img.jagranjosh.com/images/2023/June/2062023/find-the-cat-in-leaves.jpg) at all. [Phobos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon))' orbit around Mars is continually decaying -- it will likely [break up](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.P51C1423H/abstract) with pieces crashing to the Martian surface in about 50 million years.
