Will the sky be clear enough to see the eclipse? This question is already on the minds of many North Americans hoping to see [tomorrow's solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/). This question was also on the mind of many people attempting to see the total solar eclipse that crossed North America in [August 2017](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEmono/TSE2017/TSE2017.html). Then, the path of total darkness shot across the mainland of the [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) from [coast to coast](https://youtu.be/wxiMrvDbq3s), from [Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon) to [South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina) -- but, like tomorrow's event, a partial eclipse occurred above most of [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America). Unfortunately, in 2017, many locations [saw predominantly clouds](https://images.ctfassets.net/2djrn56blv6r/7rAzwZd1uxcIsKO7ZfJqVL/686320c46e6ff8d63191f3a8eb33de1f/sad-cat-header.jpg). One location that did not was a bank of the [Green River Lakes](https://youtu.be/DQoMKHMev6o), [Wyoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming). Intermittent clouds were far enough away to allow the center image of the [featured composite sequence](https://www.launchphotography.com/Total_Solar_Eclipse_2017.html) to be taken, an image that shows the [corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240402.html) of the Sun extending out past the central dark [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/) that blocks [our familiar Sun](https://solar-center.stanford.edu/interview/nemiroff.html). The surrounding images show the [partial phase](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180211.html)s of the solar eclipse both before and after totality.
