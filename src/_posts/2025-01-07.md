It was a new year, and the sky was doubly red. The new year meant that the [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) had returned to its usual place in its orbit on January 1, a place a few days before its [closest approach](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250104.html) to the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/). The first of the two red skyglows, on the left, was a [red aurora](https://img.apmcdn.org/7a6d073179a68e50dbf9833adb72225a76554a51/uncropped/0011cd-20241011-nws-aurora-colors-webp1000.webp), complete with [vertical rays](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061218.html), caused by a [blast](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240818.html) from the Sun pushing charged particles into Earth's atmosphere. The second red glow, most prominent on the far right, was possibly a [SAR arc](https://eos.org/research-spotlights/from-sar-arc-to-steve-an-atmospheric-evolution) caused by a river of charged particles flowing across [Earth's atmosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-atmosphere/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/). Although both appear red, the [slight color difference](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-do-my-cats-from-the-same-litter-look-so-different-v0-gp1xxwpi7p9c1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D320%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D8de4979921dc03f68f8f5f58e849277569ff450e) is likely due to the aurora being emitted by both oxygen and nitrogen, whereas the higher [SAR arc](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231111.html) was possibly emitted more purely by atmospheric oxygen. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DEVPPQENcXD) was taken on January 1 from near [Pieve di Cadore](https://youtu.be/HktA997YN0Y) in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy).
