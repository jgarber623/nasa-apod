Itâ€™s [the end](https://youtu.be/8OyBtMPqpNY?t=48) of a world as we know it. Specifically, the Sun-like star [ZTF SLRN-2020](https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/star-eats-planet-brightens-dramatically) was seen eating one of its own planets. Although many a planet eventually dies by spiraling into their central star, the [2020 event](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05842-x), involving a Jupiter-like planet, was the first time it was [seen directly](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/caught-in-the-act-astronomers-detect-a-star-devouring-a-planet). The star [ZTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwicky_Transient_Facility) SLRN-2020 lies about 12,000 [light year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/)s from the Sun toward the constellation of the Eagle ([Aquila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_(constellation))). In the [featured animated illustration](https://caltech.app.box.com/v/ZTF-NEOWISE-STAR-PLANET) of the incident, the gas planet's atmosphere is first pictured being stripped away as it skims along the outskirts of the attracting star. Some of the planet's gas is absorbed into the star's atmosphere, while other gas is [expelled into space](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210427.html). By the video's end, the [planet is completely engulfed](https://live.staticflickr.com/5613/15634745431_af629b9374.jpg) and falls into the star's center, causing the star's outer atmosphere to briefly expand, heat up, and brighten. One day, [about eight billion years](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.386..155S/abstract) from now, planet [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html) may spiral into our [Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/).
