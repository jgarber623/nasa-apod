New landers are on the Moon. Nearly two weeks ago, [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan)'s [Smart Lander for Investigating Moon](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/current/slim.html) (SLIM) released two rovers as it descended, before its main lander touched down itself. The larger of the two rovers can [hop like a frog](https://youtu.be/tP2TWhDVPVY), while the smaller rover is about the size of a [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_(ball)) and can move after [pulling itself apart](https://youtu.be/F9ImPb8EnPU) like a [transformer](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/a-mini-moon-rover-from-the-toy-company-that-created-transformers). The main lander, nicknamed Moon Sniper, is seen in the [featured image](https://www.jaxa.jp/press/2024/01/20240125-4_j.html) taken by the smaller rover. Inspection of the image shows that [Moon Sniper](https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/missions/spacecraft/current/slim.html)'s thrusters are facing up, meaning that the lander is [upside down](https://img2.joyreactor.cc/pics/post/%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%8D-%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C-3650094.jpeg) from its descent configuration and on its side from its intended [landing configuration](https://youtu.be/57hS8uLU7v4). One result is that [Moon Sniper](https://global.jaxa.jp/countdown/slim_special_site.html)'s [solar panel](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap091130.html)s are not in the [expected orientation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/science/japan-moon-lander-slim.html), so that [powering](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/what-powers-a-spacecraft/) the lander had to be curtailed and adapted. [SLIM](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=2023-137D)'s lander has [already succeeded as a technology demonstration](https://youtu.be/nvXLt3ET9mE?t=11800), its main mission, but was not designed to withstand the lunar night -- which [starts tomorrow](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5187/).
