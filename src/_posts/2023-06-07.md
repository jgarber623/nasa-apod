Most galaxies don't have any rings of stars and gas -- why does [M94](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_94) have two? First, [spiral galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/spiral_galaxies.html) M94 has an inner ring of newly formed stars surrounding its nucleus, giving it not only an [unusual appearance](https://www.rover.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pug-2648774_1920-960x540.jpg) but also a strong interior glow. A [leading origin hypothesis](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AJ....121.1395W/abstract) holds that an elongated [knot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_%28mathematics%29#/media/File:Knot_table.svg) of stars known as a [bar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221016.html) rotates in [M94](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100114.html) and has generated a burst of [star](https://universe.nasa.gov/stars/basics/) formation in this inner ring. [Observations](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...704..618T/abstract) have also revealed another ring, an outer ring, one that is more faint, different in color, not closed, and relatively complex. What caused this outer ring is currently unknown. M94, [pictured here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CscKadTpICu/), spans about 45,000 [light years](http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html) in total, lies about 15 million light years away, and can be seen with a [small telescope](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011014.html) toward the [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/en/) of the Hunting Dogs ([Canes Venatici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canes_Venatici)).
