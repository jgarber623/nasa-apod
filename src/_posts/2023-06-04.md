Wouldn't it be fun to color in the universe? If you think so, please accept this famous astronomical illustration as a preliminary substitute. You, [your friends](https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2524371/size/tmg-article_tall.jpg), your parents or children, can print it out or even [color it digitally](https://www.thecolor.com/Category/Coloring/Planets.aspx). While [coloring](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/13/coloring-for-stress_n_5975832.html), you might be [interested to know](https://eyes.nasa.gov/curiosity/) that even though [this illustration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammarion_engraving) has appeared in [numerous places](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3329) over the past 100 years, the actual artist remains unknown. Furthermore, [the work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zp60ODhbb4) has no accepted name -- [can you think of a good one](https://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=230604)? The illustration, [first appearing](https://books.google.com/books?id=ScDVAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA163) in a [book](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k408619m/f4.image) by [Camille Flammarion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Flammarion) in 1888, is [frequently used](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Flammarion_Woodcut) to show that humanity's present concepts are [susceptible](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=6509044552448437&set=gm.10161140528949235&idorvanity=72392414234) to [being supplanted](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010101.html) by greater truths.
