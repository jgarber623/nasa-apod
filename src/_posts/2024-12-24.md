What do the following things have in common: a cone, the fur of a fox, and a Christmas tree? Answer: they all occur in the constellation of the Unicorn ([Monoceros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoceros)). Considered as a star forming region and [cataloged as NGC 2264](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_2264), the complex jumble of cosmic gas and dust is about 2,700 light-years distant and mixes reddish [emission nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_nebula) excited by energetic light from newborn stars [with dark](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080508.html) interstellar dust clouds. The [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/ge7kmz/) spans an angle larger than a [full moon](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/phases-of-the-moon-2/), covering over 50 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) at the distance of NGC 2264. Its cast of cosmic characters includes the [Fox Fur Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151230.html), whose convoluted pelt lies just to the left of the image center, bright [variable star](https://youtu.be/sXJBrRmHPj8) [S Mon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_Monocerotis) visible just to the right of the Fox Fur, and the [Cone Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240204.html) near the image top. With the [Cone Nebula](https://esahubble.org/videos/astro_w/) at the [peak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Awww/comments/18bhfv3/always_an_angel_on_top_of_the_christmas_tree/#lightbox), the shape of the general glow of the region give it the nickname of the [Christmas Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree) Cluster, where stars are tree ornaments.
