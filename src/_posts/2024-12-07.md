You might not think a close up view of rocket engines producing 8.8 million pounds of thrust would be relaxing, but here it can be. In fact, you can get a warm and cozy feeling just spending a few moments watching [NASA's holiday rocket engine fireplace](https://plus.nasa.gov/video/nasa-rocket-engine-fireplace/). The video features a loop of the Space Launch System rocket's [RS-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-25) main engines throttled up and running flanked by solid rocket boosters and framed by a stone fireplace. The accompanying audio track mixes the drastically muted sounds of the rocket engines firing with the more familiar sounds of a burning, crackling wood fire. AI elements are included in the composed video along with an image and logo from the [Artemis I](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231130.html) mission. The Artemis I uncrewed mission to the Moon and back again launched in November 2022 on a [Space Launch System](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/) rocket.
