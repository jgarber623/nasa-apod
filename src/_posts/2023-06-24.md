The multicolor, stereo imaging [Mastcam-Z](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/mastcam-z/for-scientists/) on the Perseverance rover [zoomed in to capture](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA24547) this 3D close-up (get out your red/blue glasses) of the [Mars Ingenuity helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/) on mission sol 45. That's Earth-date 2021 April 5. [Casting a shadow](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/?begin_sol=58&end_sol=58&af=HELI_NAV,HELI_RTE) on the Martian surface, Ingenuity is standing alone on its four landing legs next to the rover's wheel tracks. The experimental helicopter's solar panel, charging batteries that keep it warm through the [cold Martian nights](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8906/nasas-mars-helicopter-survives-first-cold-martian-night-on-its-own/) and power its flight, sits just above Ingenuity's two 1.2 meter (4 foot) long counter-rotating blades. [Thirteen sols later](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/videos/?v=535), on April 19, Ingenuity became the first aircraft to perform powered, controlled flight on another planet. [It has since gone on](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/9421/landing-in-living-rooms-lego-models-of-nasa-mars-rover-and-helicopter/) to complete more than 50 flights through the thin atmosphere of Mars.
