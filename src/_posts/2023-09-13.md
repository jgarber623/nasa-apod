Galaxy NGC 4632 hides a secret from optical telescopes. It is surrounded by a ring of cool [hydrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml) gas orbiting at 90 degrees to its spiral disk. Such [polar ring galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990510.html) have previously been discovered using starlight. However, NGC 4632 is among the first in which a [radio](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves) [telescope](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/radio-telescopes/) survey revealed a polar ring. The [featured composite image](https://youtu.be/dkMr-D2719w) combines this gas ring, observed with the highly sensitive [ASKAP telescope](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/facilities-collections/atnf/askap-radio-telescope), with optical data from the [Subaru telescope](https://subarutelescope.org/). Using [virtual reality](https://images.nasa.gov/details/ARC-1992-AC89-0437-6), astronomers separated out the gas in the main disk of the galaxy from the ring, and the subtle color gradient traces its orbital motion. Why do [polar rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar-ring_galaxy) exist? They could be material [pulled](https://www.rover.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/dog-playing-tug.jpg) from one galaxy as it [gravitationally interacts](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190811.html) with a companion. Or hydrogen gas flows along the [filaments of the cosmic web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-H3WzaewdY) and accretes into a ring around a galaxy, some of which gravitationally contracts into stars.
