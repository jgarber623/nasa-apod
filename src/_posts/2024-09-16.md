Why does this large crater on Mercury have two rings and a smooth floor? No one is sure. The unusual feature called [Vivaldi Crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivaldi_\(crater\)) spans 215 kilometers and was imaged again in [great detail](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/BepiColombo/BepiColombo_s_best_images_yet_highlight_fourth_Mercury_flyby) by [ESA](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Corporate_news/ESA_facts)'s and [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/about/jaxa/index.html)'s robotic [BepiColombo](https://sci.esa.int/web/bepicolombo/-/33022-summary) spacecraft on a [flyby](https://youtu.be/vtP92WeCVYQ) earlier this month. A large circular feature on a rocky planet or moon is usually caused by either an [impact](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/impact-crater/) by a small asteroid or a comet fragment, or a [volcanic eruption](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210303.html). In the [case](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.P33B1943B/abstract) of [Vivaldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Vivaldi), it is possible that [both occurred](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-new-detailed-photos-of-mercury-from-a-spacecrafts-closest-flyby-yet-180985040/) -- a heavy strike that caused a smooth internal lava flow. [Double-ringed craters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_ring) are rare, and the cause of the inner rings remains a [topic of research](https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/d_642250b563292b35f27461a7.png,f_jpg,fl_progressive,q_auto,w_1024/a3e47wjih6jh8ilxwxcz.jpg). The speed-slowing [gravity-assist](https://science.nasa.gov/learn/basics-of-space-flight/primer/)ed [flyby](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200504.html) of [Mercury](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190428.html) by [BepiColombo](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/bepicolombo/) was in preparation for the spacecraft entering orbit around the [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/solar-system-facts/)'s [innermost planet](https://science.nasa.gov/mercury/) in 2026.
