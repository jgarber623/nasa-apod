[Bright elliptical galaxy Messier 87 (M87)](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100520.html) is home to the supermassive black hole captured in 2017 by planet Earth's [Event Horizon Telescope](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/blog) in the first ever image of a black hole. Giant of the Virgo galaxy cluster about 55 million light-years away, M87 is the large galaxy rendered in blue hues in this infrared [image from the Spitzer Space telescope](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA23122). Though M87 appears mostly featureless and cloud-like, the Spitzer image does record details of relativistic jets blasting from the galaxy's central region. Shown in the inset at top right, the jets themselves span thousands of light-years. [The brighter jet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap041211.html) seen on the right is approaching and close to our line of sight. Opposite, the shock created by the otherwise unseen receding jet lights up a fainter arc of material. Inset at bottom right, the [historic black hole image](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190411.html) is shown in context, at the center of giant galaxy and relativistic jets. Completely unresolved in the Spitzer image, the [supermassive](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/nasa-animation-sizes-up-the-universe-s-biggest-black-holes) black hole surrounded by infalling material is the source of enormous energy driving [the relativistic jets from the center of active galaxy M87](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/telescopes-unite-in-unprecedented-observations-of-famous-black-hole.html). The Event Horizon Telescope image of M87 has now been enhanced to reveal a [sharper view of the famous supermassive black hole](https://noirlab.edu/public/news/noirlab2310/).
