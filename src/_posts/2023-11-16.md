[Venus now](https://science.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/) appears as Earth's brilliant morning star, shining above the southeastern horizon before dawn. For early morning risers, the silvery celestial beacon rose predawn in a close pairing with a waning crescent Moon on Thursday, November 9. But from some [northern locations](https://www.icelandreview.com/nature-travel/moon-and-venus-meet-in-icelands-morning-sky/), the Moon was seen to occult or pass in front of Venus. From much of Europe, the lunar occultation could be [viewed in daylight skies](https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/898759-daytime-occultation-of-venus-november-9-2023/). This time series composite follows the daytime approach of Moon and morning star in blue skies from Warsaw, Poland. The progression of eight [sharp telescopic snapshots](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=326275853434332&set=pb.100081557586336.-2207520000), made between 10:56am and 10:58am local time, runs from left to right, when Venus winked out behind the [bright lunar limb](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap081206.html).
