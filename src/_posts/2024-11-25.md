One of the most identifiable nebulas in the sky, the [Horsehead Nebula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsehead_Nebula) in [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_\(constellation\)), is part of a large, dark, [molecular cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html). Also known as [Barnard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Emerson_Barnard) 33, the unusual shape was first [discovered](http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/b33.html) on a [photographic plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_plate) in the late 1800s. The red glow originates from [hydrogen](http://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml) gas predominantly behind the nebula, ionized by the nearby bright star [Sigma Orionis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Orionis). The darkness of the [Horsehead](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221229.html) is caused mostly by thick [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html), although the lower part of the [Horsehead](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap081126.html)'s neck casts a [shadow](https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/funny-shadow-fails-illusions-1.jpg) to the left. Streams of gas leaving [the nebula](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgTrLozRj40) are funneled by a strong [magnetic field](https://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Imagnet.html). Bright spots in the [Horsehead Nebula](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987AJ.....93.1514Z/abstract)'s base are young stars just in the [process of forming](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-highlights/exploring-the-birth-of-stars/). Light takes about 1,500 years to reach us from the [Horsehead Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090224.html). The [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/h2afic/) was taken from the [Chilescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHILESCOPE) Observatory in the [mountains](https://youtu.be/tCZ9jz5pc9E) of [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile).
