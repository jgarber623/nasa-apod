Will Comet Nishimura become visible to the unaided eye? Given the unpredictability of comets, no one can say for sure, but it currently seems like a good bet. The comet was [discovered](http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iau/cbet/005200/CBET005285.txt) only ten days ago by Hideo Nishimura during 30-second exposures with a standard digital camera. Since then, [C/2023 P1 Nishimura](https://www.universetoday.com/162802/comet-p1-nishimura-could-be-bright-over-the-next-few-weeks/) has increased in brightness and its path across the inner [Solar System](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/) determined. As the comet dives toward the Sun, it will surely continue to [intensify and possibly become](http://aerith.net/comet/catalog/2023P1/2023P1.html) a naked-eye object in early September. A problem is that [the comet](https://earthsky.org/tonight/new-comet-c-2023-p1-nishimura-bright-august-september-october-2023/) will also be angularly near the Sun, so it will only be possible to see it [near sunset or sunrise](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MnQVQct8L._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg). The comet will get so [close to the Sun](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=700742702067209&set=a.419550426853106) -- inside the orbit of [planet Mercury](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-mercury/) -- that its nucleus may [break up](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200416.html). [Pictured](https://www.astrobin.com/t57un4/B/), Comet Nishimura was imaged three days ago from [June Lake](https://youtu.be/upj8BRfn0yU), [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) while sporting a green coma and a thin tail.
