What happens to a star that goes near a black hole? If the star directly impacts a massive [black hole](https://www1.phys.vt.edu/~jhs/faq/blackholes.html), then the star falls in completely -- and everything vanishes. [More likely](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/black-holes-caught-act-swallowing-stars), though, the star goes close enough to have the black hole's gravity pull away its outer layers, or [disrupt, the star](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/tidal-disruption/). Then, most of the star's gas does not fall into the [black hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191001.html). These stellar [tidal disruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_disruption_event) events can be as bright as a supernova, and an increasing amount of them are being discovered by automated [sky surveys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_survey#List_of_sky_surveys). In the [featured artist's illustration](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia20027-infrared-echoes-of-a-black-hole-eating-a-star-illustration), a star has just passed a massive [black hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210427.html) and sheds gas that continues to orbit. The inner edge of a disk of gas and dust [surrounding the black hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200825.html) is heated by the [disruption event](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151028.html) and may [glow](https://media.sciencephoto.com/image/z9340730/800wm/Z9340730.jpg) long after the star is gone.
