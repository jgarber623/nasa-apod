What is the cause of this unusual parabolic structure? This illuminated cavity, known as [LDN 1471](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/nebula-catalog/ldn.html), was created by a newly forming [star](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/), seen as the bright source at the peak of the [parabola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola). This [protostar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar) is experiencing a [stellar outflow](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-astro-081915-023341) which is then interacting with the surrounding material in the [Perseus Molecular Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_molecular_cloud), causing it to brighten. We see only one side of the cavity -- the other side is hidden by dark [dust](https://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/images/173). The [parabolic shape](https://www.mathwarehouse.com/quadratic/parabola/interactive-parabola.php) is caused by the widening of the [stellar-wind](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200308.html) blown cavity over time. Two additional structures can also be seen either side of the [protostar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130904.html); these are known as [Herbig-Haro object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbig%E2%80%93Haro_object)s, again caused by the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding material. What causes the [striations](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/striation#/media/File:Striation_II_\(3770181363\).jpg) on the cavity walls, though, [remains unknown](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/world/17grumpycat-1/17grumpycat-1-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg). The [featured image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/48507562636/in/dateposted/) was taken by NASA and ESAâ€™s [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble) after an original detection by the [Spitzer Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/spitzer/).
