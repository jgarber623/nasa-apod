Spanning light-years, this [suggestive](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/?#abs/1916ApJ....43....1B) shape known as the Seahorse Nebula floats in silhouette against a rich, luminous background of stars. Seen toward the royal northern constellation of Cepheus, the dusty, dark nebula is part of a Milky Way molecular cloud some 1,200 light-years distant. It is also listed as Barnard 150 (B150), one of 182 [dark markings of the sky](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1919ApJ....49....1B) cataloged in the early 20th century by astronomer [E. E. Barnard](https://exhibit-archive.library.gatech.edu/barnard/). Packs of low mass stars are forming [within](https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4761), but their collapsing cores are only visible at long [infrared wavelengths](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves). Still, the colorful Milky Way stars of Cepheus add to this stunning [galactic skyscape](https://www.instagram.com/astro.db/p/C-ZwOQTNuH9/?img_index=1).
