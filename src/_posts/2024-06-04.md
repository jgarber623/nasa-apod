Why does [Comet Pons-Brooks](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/) now have tails pointing in opposite directions? The most [spectacular tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210308.html) is the blue-glowing [ion tail](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/c/Cometary+Gas+Tail) that is visible flowing down the image. The ion tail is [pushed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220110.html) directly out from the Sun by the [solar wind](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-solar-wind-across-our-solar-system/). On the upper right is the glowing central coma of [Comet 12P/Ponsâ€“Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12P/Pons%E2%80%93Brooks). Fanning out from the [coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_\(comet\)), mostly to the left, is the comet's [dust tail](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/Cometary+Dust+Tail). Pushed out and slowed down by the [pressure of sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting%E2%80%93Robertson_effect), the dust tail tends to trail the comet along its orbit and, from [some viewing angles](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/en/anatomy-of-a-comet.en.jpg), can appear [opposite](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190624.html) to the ion tail. The distant, bright star [Alpha Leporis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Leporis) is seen at the bottom of the [featured image](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=8297831726911868&set=a.100321199996336) captured last week from [Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia). Two days ago, the comet passed its closest to the [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html) and is now best visible from southern skies as it dims and [glides](https://youtu.be/L9mrTdYhOHg) back to the outer [Solar System](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220911.html).
