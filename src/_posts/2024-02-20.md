When galaxies collide, how many stars are born? For AM1054-325, [featured here](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2024/news-2024-004) in a recently released image by the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/), the answer is millions. Instead of stars [being destroyed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171016.html) as galaxy AM1054-325 and a nearby galaxy [circle each other](https://youtu.be/TI5j-6vGGnA), their gravity and motion has [ignited stellar creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starburst_galaxy). Star formation occurs rapidly in the gaseous debris stretching from [AM1054-325](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2024/004/01HN3A68AHYZ7YV50T5G2D2K0Y)’s yellowish body due to the other galaxy’s gravitational pull. Hydrogen gas surrounding newborn [stars glows pink](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap020613.html). Bright infant [stars shine blue](https://www.astronomy.com/science/young-hot-and-blue-stars-in-cluster-ngc-2547/) and cluster together in compact nurseries of thousands to [millions of stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210110.html). AM1054-325 possesses over 100 of these intense-blue, [dot-like star clusters](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.2341R/abstract), some appearing like a [string](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap020525.html) [of](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040220.html) [pearls](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing?id=10966). Analyzing [ultraviolet light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/) helped determine that most of these stars are less than 10 million years old: [stellar babies](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/four-fluffy-golden-british-longhair-cat-isolated-white-background-kittens-sitting-dark-brown-jewelery-box-pearls-127733819.jpg). Many of these nurseries may grow up to be [globular star clusters](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230130.html), while the bundle of young stars at the bottom tip may even [detach and form a small galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151121.html).
