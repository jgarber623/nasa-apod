Are Saturn's auroras like Earth's? To help answer this question, the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/about-hubble/) and the [Cassini spacecraft](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/about-the-mission/) monitored Saturn's North Pole simultaneously during [Cassini's final orbits](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170125.html) around the gas giant in September 2017. During this time, [Saturn](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/)'s tilt caused its North Pole to be [clearly visible](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150621.html) from Earth. The [featured image](https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1815a/) is a composite of [ultraviolet images](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) of auroras and optical images of Saturn's clouds and rings, all taken by Hubble. Like on Earth, Saturn's northern auroras can make [total or partial rings](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap081119.html) around the pole. Unlike on Earth, however, [Saturn's auroras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Saturn#Aurorae) are frequently spirals -- and more likely to [peak](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1097010202/photo/portrait-of-a-funny-cat-looking-out-of-the-box.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=xhduCYxVsageM8F5_Ot0JFFwB6edgD5pLHoc6gmj3bU=) in brightness just before midnight and dawn. In contrast to [Jupiter's auroras](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220830.html), [Saturn's auroras](https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1815/) appear better related to connecting Saturn's internal magnetic field to the nearby, variable, [solar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind). [Saturn's southern auroras](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050219.html) were similarly imaged back in 2004 when the [planet's South Pole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050222.html) was clearly visible to Earth.
