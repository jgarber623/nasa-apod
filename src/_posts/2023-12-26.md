Why is this jellyfish swimming in a sea of stars? Drifting near bright star [Eta Geminorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Geminorum), seen at the right, the [Jellyfish Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_443) extends its tentacles from the bright arcing ridge of emission left of center. In fact, the cosmic [jellyfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish) is part of bubble-shaped [supernova remnant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_remnant) IC 443, the expanding debris cloud from a [massive star that exploded](https://youtu.be/Q5UEMkvdnAc). Light from the explosion first reached [planet Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) over [30,000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic). Like its cousin in astronomical waters, the [Crab Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231115.html) supernova remnant IC 443 is [known to harbor](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060602.html) a [neutron star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star) -- the remnant of the collapsed stellar core. The Jellyfish Nebula is about 5,000 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) away. At that distance, the [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/cgp7eo/B/) would [span](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9f/f7/24/9ff7249d652f407a5af1b6ac9827c917.jpg) about 140 light-years across.
