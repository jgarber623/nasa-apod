What are these unusual interstellar structures? Bright-rimmed, flowing shapes gather near the center of [this rich starfield](https://www.hansonastronomy.com/cg-30-cometary-globule) toward the borders of the nautical southern [constellations Pupis and Vela](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argo_Navis). Composed of interstellar gas and dust, the grouping of light-year sized cometary globules is about 1300 [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/)s distant. Energetic ultraviolet light from nearby hot stars [has molded the globules](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap071215.html) and ionized their bright rims. [The globules also](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502285) stream away from the [Vela supernova remnant](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190110.html) which may have influenced their swept-back shapes. Within them, cores of cold gas and dust are likely [collapsing](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BUCOEePIcAAht9h.jpg) to form low mass stars, whose formation will ultimately cause the [globules to disperse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230104.html). In fact, cometary globule CG 30 (on the upper left) sports a small reddish glow near its head, [a telltale sign](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990MNRAS.242..419S/abstract) of energetic jets from a star in the early stages [of formation](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-highlights/exploring-the-birth-of-stars/).
