What did the monster active region that created the recent auroras look like when at the Sun's edge? There, [AR 3664](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240511.html) better showed its 3D structure. Pictured, a large multi-pronged [solar prominence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230801.html) was captured extending from chaotic [sunspot region AR 3664](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240513.html) out into space, just one example of the particle clouds ejected from this violent solar region. The Earth could [easily fit under](https://3dnews.ru/assets/external/illustrations/2013/11/01/774378/kitty.jpg) this long-extended prominence. The featured image was captured two days ago from this constantly changing region. Yesterday, the [strongest solar](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sun-erupts-with-largest-flare-of-this-solar-cycle-but-auroras-unlikely/) flare [in years](https://www.sws.bom.gov.au/Educational/2/3/9) was expelled (not shown), a blast classified in the upper [X-class](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/10109/). [Ultraviolet](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/) light from that flare quickly hit the [Earth's atmosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-atmosphere/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/) and caused shortwave [radio blackouts](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/solar-flares-radio-blackouts) across both [North and South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas). Although [now rotated](https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&day=14&month=05&year=2024) to be facing slightly away from the Earth, particles from AR 3664 and subsequent [coronal mass ejections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection) (CMEs) might still follow [curved magnetic field](https://spaceweather.com/repeat_images/parkerspiral2.png) lines [across](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliospheric_current_sheet) the inner [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/facts/) and create more [Earthly auroras](https://www.facebook.com/media/set?set=a.431368006258449&type=3).
