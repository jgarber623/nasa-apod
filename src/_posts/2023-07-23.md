It does what? No one knew that 2,000 years ago, the technology existed to build such a device. The [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism), pictured, is now widely regarded as the [first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#Pre-20th_century) [computer](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/decoding-antikythera-mechanism-first-computer-180953979/). Found at the bottom of the sea aboard a decaying [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece) ship, its complexity prompted decades of study, and even today some of its functions likely [remain unknown](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0530/4500/2416/articles/confused-dog-featured-126785.jpg). [X-ray](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays) images of the device, however, have confirmed that a main function of its numerous clock-like [wheels and gears](https://youtu.be/RLPVCJjTNgk) is to create a portable, hand-cranked, Earth-centered, [orrery of the sky](https://youtu.be/tmNuG15cqNw?t=410), predicting future star and planet locations as well as [lunar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190120.html) and [solar eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170912.html)s. The corroded core of the [Antikythera mechanism](http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/)'s largest gear is featured, spanning about 13 centimeters, while the [entire mechanism](https://youtu.be/UpLcnAIpVRA) was 33 centimeters high, making it similar in size to a large book. Recently, [modern computer modeling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84310-w) of missing components is allowing for the creation of a more complete replica of this [surprising ancient machine](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56377567).
