Something strange happened to this galaxy, but what? Known as the [Cigar Galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230802.html) and cataloged as [M82](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_82), red glowing gas and dust are being cast out from the center. Although this [starburst galaxy](http://burro.case.edu/Academics/Astr222/Galaxies/Peculiar/starburst.html) was surely stirred up by a recent pass near its [neighbor](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160203.html), large spiral galaxy [M81](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210312.html), this doesn't fully explain the source of the red-glowing outwardly expanding gas and [dust](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain). Evidence indicates that this material is being driven out by the combined emerging [particle winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind) of many stars, together creating a [galactic superwind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_superwind). In the [featured images](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/109/01HRD12PNCS1RFCS4VAHWPZDGQ), a [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/about-hubble/) image in [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) is shown on the left, while a [James Webb Space Telescope](https://webb.nasa.gov/content/about/index.html) image of the central region in [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) is shown on the right. [Detailed inspection](https://www.ardeaprints.com/p/172/cat-black-white-cat-garden-looking-plant-3749006.jpg.webp) of the [new Webb image](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2024/news-2024-109) shows, unexpectedly, that this red-glowing dust is associated with [hot plasma](https://youtu.be/3vtGktz8c1M). [Research](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240116648B/abstract) into the nature of [this strange nearby galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230802.html) will surely continue.
