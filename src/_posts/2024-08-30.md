[The Moon's south pole](http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/237) is toward the top left of this [detailed telescopic moonscape](https://fenyeslorand.hu/naprendszerunk/). Captured on August 23, it looks across the rugged southern lunar highlands. The view's foreshortened perspective heightens the impression of a dense field of craters and makes the craters themselves appear more oval shaped close to the lunar limb. Prominent [near center is](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2408/lorand_fenyes_hold_0016_south_pole.jpg) 114 kilometer diameter crater Moretus. Moretus is young for a large lunar crater and features terraced inner walls and a 2.1 kilometer high, central peak, similar in appearance to the more northerly [young crater Tycho](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210805.html). Mountains visible along the lunar limb at the top can rise about 6 kilometers or so above the surrounding terrain. Close to the lunar south pole, [permanently shadowed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230505.html) crater floors with expected reservoirs of water-ice have made the rugged south polar region of the Moon a [popular target for exploration](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-identifies-candidate-regions-for-landing-next-americans-on-moon/).
