In dramatic silhouette against a cloudy daytime sky over Paris, France, gargoyles cast their monstrous gaze outward from the [west facade](https://www.friendsofnotredamedeparis.org/cathedral/artifacts/west-facade/) of Notre Dame Cathedral. [Taken on March 29](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/mar-29-2025-eclipse/), this telephoto snapshot also captures the [dramatic](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250330.html) silhouette of a New Moon against the bright solar disk in a partial solar eclipse. Happening high in Parisian skies, the partial eclipse was close to its maximum phase of about 23 percent. Occurring near the end of the first [eclipse season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_season) of 2025, this partial solar eclipse followed the total eclipse of the [Full Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250315.html) on March 13/14. [The upcoming](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/) second eclipse season of 2025 will see a total lunar eclipse on September 7/8 and partial solar eclipse on September 21. The partial solar eclipse will be seen only from locations in planet Earth's southern hemisphere.
