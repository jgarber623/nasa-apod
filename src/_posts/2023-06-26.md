You've surely seen it, but you might not have noticed it. During a cloudless [twilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight), just before [sunrise](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220924.html) or after [sunset](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230328.html), part of the atmosphere above the horizon appears slightly dark and off-color. Called the [Belt of Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_of_Venus), this transitional band between the dark [eclipsed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030822.html) sky and the bright day sky can be seen most prominently in the direction [opposite the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190624.html). Straight above, [blue sky](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/) is normal sunlight reflecting off the atmosphere, while near the horizon the clear sky can [appear more orange or red](https://www.universetoday.com/77115/why-is-the-sunset-red/). In the [Belt of Venus](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-blogs/the-belt-of-venus/), the atmosphere reflects more light from the setting (or rising) Sun and so [appears more red](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201111.html). Featured here, the [Belt of Venus](https://youtu.be/qA4umk8HGMY) was photographed over several [Himalayan mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas) including, second from the right, [Mount Everest](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110417.html), the [tallest mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountain_peaks_by_prominence) on [Earth](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/). Although usually [not mentioned](https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad2b9b2200003401da9338.jpeg), the belt is [frequently](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011209.html) [caught](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010601.html) [by](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180705.html) [accident](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120529.html) [in](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191011.html) [other](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230509.html) [photographs](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010501.html).
