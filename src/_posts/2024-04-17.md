Not one, but two comets appeared near the Sun during [last week's total solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/april-8-total-solar-eclipse-through-the-eyes-of-nasa/). The expected comet was [Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240408.html), but it was disappointingly dimmer than many had hoped. However, relatively unknown [Comet SOHO-5008 also appeared](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/49697/20240411/sungrazer-comet-soho-5008-total-solar-eclipse.htm) in long duration camera exposures. [This comet](https://www.livescience.com/space/the-sun/tiny-sungrazer-comet-discovered-photographed-and-destroyed-all-during-historic-total-solar-eclipse) was the 5008th comet identified on images taken by [ESA](https://www.esa.int/) & [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s Sun-orbiting [SOHO spacecraft](https://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/about/spacecraft.html). Likely much smaller, Comet SOHO-5008 was a sungrazer which [disintegrated within hours](https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2024/04/12/this-comet-did-not-survive-the-eclipse/) as it passed too [near the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240219.html). The featured image is not only unusual for capturing [two comets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171002.html) during an eclipse, but one of the [rare times](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/nicos-nextbots-fanmade/images/2/23/WOW_Three_Cats.png) that a [sungrazing comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungrazing_comet) has been photographed from the Earth's surface. Also visible in the image is the [sprawling corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230516.html) of [our Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) and the planets [Mercury](https://science.nasa.gov/mercury/) (left) and [Venus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220306.html) (right). Of these planets and comets, only [Venus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230306.html) was easily visible to [millions of people](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/millions-of-people-witness-rare-total-solar-eclipse-across-north-america) in the [dark shadow of the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240324.html) that [crossed North America](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when) on April 8.
