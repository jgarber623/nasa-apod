What's happening at the center of our galaxy? It's hard to tell with optical telescopes since [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight) is blocked by intervening interstellar dust. In other bands of light, though, such as [radio](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves), the [galactic center](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241124.html) can be imaged and shows itself to be quite an [interesting and active place](https://www.sarao.ac.za/media-releases/new-meerkat-radio-image-reveals-complex-heart-of-the-milky-way/). The [featured picture](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2025/115/01JQ7CMZNPQSCT4TD0Q1M1F66M) shows an image of our Milky Way's center by the [MeerKAT array](https://www.sarao.ac.za/gallery/meerkat/) of 64 radio dishes in [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa). Spanning four times the angular size of [the Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/) (2 [degrees](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/degrees.html)), the image is impressively vast, deep, and detailed. [Many known sources](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap020803.html) are shown in clear detail, including many with a prefix of Sgr, since the [galactic center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXAU0gzsPOw) is in the direction of the [constellation Sagittarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_\(constellation\)). In our galaxy's center lies [Sgr A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A), found here in the image center, which houses the [Milky Way's central supermassive black hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220513.html). Other sources in the image are not as well understood, including [the Arc](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap020521.html), just to the left of [Sgr A](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180122.html), and numerous filamentary threads. The [inset image](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2025/115/01JQ7CMZNPQSCT4TD0Q1M1F66M) shows a small patch recently imaged in [infrared light](https://webbtelescope.org/science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy) with the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/) to [investigate](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQsgYmFcVdx1JScI0IMUjsBrVQqJtvNAB7xQw&s) the effects of magnetic fields on star formation.
