A bright spiral galaxy of the northern sky, [Messier 63](http://messier.seds.org/m/m063.html) is nearby, about 30 million light-years distant toward the loyal constellation Canes Venatici. Also cataloged as NGC 5055, the majestic [island universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100109.html) is nearly 100,000 light-years across, about the size of [our own](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250513.html) Milky Way. Its bright core [and majestic](https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1536a/) spiral arms lend the galaxy its popular name, The Sunflower Galaxy. [This exceptionally deep exposure](https://app.astrobin.com/u/silkpericles?i=cbn235#gallery) also follows faint loops and curling star streams far into the galaxy's halo. Extending nearly 180,000 light-years from the galactic center, the star streams are likely remnants of [tidally disrupted](https://www.cosmotography.com/images/galaxy_cannibalism.html) satellites of M63. Other satellite galaxies of M63 can be spotted in [the remarkable wide-field image](https://www.astrobin.com/xeei1h/F/), including [dwarf galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04984), which could contribute to M63's star streams in the next few billion years.
