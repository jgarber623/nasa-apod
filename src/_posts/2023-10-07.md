This picture of Andromeda shows not only where stars are now, but where stars will be. The big, beautiful [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), M31, is a [spiral galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy) a mere 2.5 million [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) away. Image data from space-based and ground-based observatories have been combined here to produce [this intriguing composite](http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/M31-Spitzer-New-Mouseover-M.html) view of Andromeda at wavelengths both inside and outside normally visible light. The [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight) shows where M31's stars are now, highlighted in white and blue hues and imaged by the [Hubble](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/about), [Subaru](https://subarutelescope.org/en/about/), and [Mayall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_U._Mayall_Telescope) telescopes. The [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) shows where M31's future stars will soon form, highlighted in orange hues and imaged by NASA's [Spitzer Space Telescope](https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/mission/mission-overview). The infrared light tracks enormous [lanes of dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211117.html), warmed by stars, sweeping along Andromeda's spiral arms. This [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html) is a tracer of the galaxy's vast interstellar gas, raw material for future [star formation](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve). Of course, the new stars will likely form over the next hundred million years or so. That's well before Andromeda [merges](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120604.html) with our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/) in about 5 billion years.
