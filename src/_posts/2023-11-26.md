Where do comet tails come from? There are no obvious places on the [nuclei of comets](http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/small-bodies/comets-visited-by-spacecraft-2014.html) from which the [jets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150203.html) that create [comet tails](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000413.html) emanate. In 2016, though, ESA's [Rosetta spacecraft](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Europe_s_comet_chaser) not only imaged a [jet emerging](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151118.html) from [Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko), but flew right through it. Featured is [a telling picture](https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Rosetta_finds_comet_plume_powered_from_below) showing a [bright plume](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/a-plume-erupts-from-a-comet-pressured-from-below) emerging from a small circular dip bounded on one side by a 10-meter high wall. Analyses of [Rosetta data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ9ivd7wv30) show that the jet was composed of both dust and water-ice. The rugged but otherwise [unremarkable terrain](http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2017/10/Comet_plume_in_context) indicates that [something likely happened](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETbE6XDU4AIvE1d.jpg) far under the porous surface to create the plume. [This image](https://www.mps.mpg.de/Rosetta-reveals-dust-jet) was taken about two months before [Rosetta's mission ended](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161001.html) with a controlled impact onto Comet 67P's surface.
