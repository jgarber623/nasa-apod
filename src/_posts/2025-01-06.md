Billions of years from now, only one of these two galaxies will remain. Until then, spiral [galaxies](http://www.seds.org/messier/galaxy.html) NGC 2207 and IC 2163 will slowly pull each other apart, creating [tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide) of matter, sheets of [shocked gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160522.html), lanes of [dark dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220801.html), bursts of [star formation](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230828.html), and streams of [cast-away stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990327.html). The [featured image](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2024/136/01J9RRG5672MP4BPRFG31ARSV6) in scientifically assigned colors is a composite of [Hubble](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/) exposures in [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) and [Webb](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/) exposures in [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) light. [Astronomers predict](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005MNRAS.364...69S/abstract) that NGC 2207, the larger galaxy on the right, will eventually incorporate IC 2163, the smaller galaxy on the left. In the most [recent encounter](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...453..139E/abstract) that about peaked 40 million years ago, the smaller galaxy is swinging around counter-clockwise and is now [slightly behind](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/11mua7z/show_me_your_bonded_kitties/#lightbox) the larger galaxy. The space between stars is so vast that when [galaxies collide](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130514.html), the stars in them [usually do not](https://www.wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/2024/06/25/does-everything-get-smashed-to-bits-when-two-galaxies-collide/) collide.
