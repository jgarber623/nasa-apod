By starlight, this eerie visage shines in the dark with a crooked profile evoking its popular name, the [Witch Head Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061211.html). In fact, this entrancing [telescopic portrait](https://www.flickr.com/photos/197697877@N05/53527999667/) gives the impression that a witch has fixed her gaze on Orion's bright supergiant [star Rigel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel). More formally known as [IC 2118](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_2118), the Witch Head Nebula spans about 50 light-years and is composed of interstellar dust grains reflecting [Rigel's starlight](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997MNRAS.290..521I/abstract). The color of the Witch Head Nebula is caused not only by Rigel's intense blue light, but because the [dust grains scatter blue light](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain) more efficiently than red. The same [physical process](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/blusky.html) causes [Earth's daytime sky](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/) to appear blue, although the scatterers in Earth's atmosphere are molecules of nitrogen and oxygen. Rigel and this dusty cosmic crone are about 800 light-years away. You may still see a few witches in your neighborhood tonight though, so have a safe and [Happy Halloween!](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/immersive/galaxy-of-horrors/)
