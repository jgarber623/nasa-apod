Comets can be huge. When far from the Sun, a comet's size usually refers to its [hard nucleus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160202.html) of ice and rock, which typically spans a few kilometers -- smaller than even a [small moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240907.html). When [nearing the Sun](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Sungrazer_comets), however, this [nucleus](https://www.cometcampaign.org/files/images/comets_spacecraft.jpg) can [eject dust and gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151118.html) and leave a thin tail that can spread to an [enormous length](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241006.html) -- even greater than the distance between the [Earth](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/) and the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/). Pictured, C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) sports a [tail of sunlight-reflecting dust](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/*/Cometary+Dust+Tail) and glowing gas that spans several times the apparent size of a full [moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120205.html), appearing [even larger](https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/4hase2/psbattle_shocked_cat/) on [long duration camera image](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240131.html)s than to the unaided eye. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DFMBN5sgk3K/) shows impressive Comet ATLAS over trees and a grass field in [Sierras de Mahoma](https://youtu.be/3j-2hr1WC_k), [San Jose](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Q3gIT1i1n3E), [Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay) about a week ago. After being [prominent in the sunset skies of Earth's southern hemisphere,](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250124.html) [Comet G3 ATLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_G3_\(ATLAS\)) is [now fading](https://theskylive.com/c2024g3-info) as it moves away from the Sun, making its impressive tails increasingly hard to see.
