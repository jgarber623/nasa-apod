On December 5, 2022, a camera on board the uncrewed Orion spacecraft captured [this view as Orion](https://flickr.com/photos/nasa2explore/52547306790/in/album-72177720303788800/) approached its return powered flyby of the Moon. Beyond one of Orion's extended solar arrays lies dark, smooth, terrain along the [western](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220128.html) edge of the Oceanus Procellarum. Prominent on the lunar nearside [Oceanus Procellarum](https://earthsky.org/space/new-ideas-about-origin-of-lunar-ocean-of-storms/), the Ocean of Storms, is the largest of the [Moon's lava-flooded maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare). The lunar terminator, shadow line between lunar night and day, runs along the left of this frame. The 41 kilometer diameter [crater Marius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marius_(crater)) is top center, with ray [crater Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_(lunar_crater)) peeking in at the edge, just right of the solar array wing. Kepler's bright rays extend to the north and west, reaching the [dark-floored Marius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marius_(crater)). On December 11, 2022 the Orion spacecraft [reached its home world](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2022/12/11/artemis-i-flight-day-26-orion-splashes-down-concluding-historic-artemis-i-mission/). The historic Artemis 1 mission ended with Orion's successful splashdown in [planet Earth's](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/apollo-17-astronauts-capture-iconic-blue-marble-50-years-ago) water-flooded Pacific Ocean.
