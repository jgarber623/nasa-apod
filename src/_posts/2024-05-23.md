Spiral galaxy NGC 3169 looks to be unraveling like a ball of cosmic yarn. It lies some 70 million light-years away, [south of](http://www.eso.org/public/videos/eso1114a/) bright star Regulus toward the faint constellation Sextans. Wound up spiral arms are pulled out into sweeping tidal tails as NGC 3169 (left) and neighboring NGC 3166 [interact gravitationally](https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-ngc3166/). Eventually the galaxies will merge into one, a common fate even for bright galaxies in [the local universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120604.html). Drawn out stellar arcs and plumes are clear indications of the ongoing gravitational interactions across the deep and colorful [galaxy group](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galgrps/leoii.html) photo. [The telescopic frame](https://www.astrobin.com/ai8tao/) spans about 20 arc minutes or about 400,000 light-years at the group's estimated distance, and includes smaller, bluish NGC 3165 to the right. NGC 3169 is also known to shine across the spectrum from radio to X-rays, [harboring](http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4382) an active galactic nucleus that is the site of a supermassive black hole.
