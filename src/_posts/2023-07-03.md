Why is Venus so different from Earth? To help find out, [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan) launched the robotic [Akatsuki](http://global.jaxa.jp/article/2016/interview/vol95/index.html) spacecraft which [entered orbit](http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2015/02/20150206_akatsuki.html) around Venus late in 2015 after an unplanned five-year adventure around the inner [Solar System](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/). Even though [Akatsuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akatsuki_(spacecraft)) was past its original planned lifetime, the spacecraft and instruments were operating so well that much of its original mission was [reinstated](http://spaceflightnow.com/2016/05/17/japanese-orbiter-officially-begins-science-mission-at-venus/). Also known as the [Venus](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/indepth) Climate Orbiter, [Akatsuki's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsDj-KJe65s) instruments [investigated unknowns](http://www.gapphotos.com/images/WebPreview/0100/0100358.jpg) about Earth's sister planet, including whether [volcanoes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap950928.html) are still active, whether lightning occurs in the dense atmosphere, and why wind speeds [greatly exceed](http://phys.org/news/2010-05-theory-superrotation-venus.html) the planet's rotation speed. In the [featured image](https://akatsuki.isas.jaxa.jp/en/gallery/data/001105.html) taken by [Akatsuki](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/akatsuki)'s UVI camera, the day-side of [Venus](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/overview/) is seen shown with planet-scale [V-shaped](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200915.html) cloud pattern. The image displays three [ultraviolet](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) colors and indicates a dip in the relative abundance of [sulfur dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide) shown in faint blue. Analyses of [Akatsuki images](https://darts.jaxa.jp/planet/project/akatsuki/) and data has shown, among [other discoveries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akatsuki_(spacecraft)#Science), that Venus has [equatorial jet](https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/planet_c/topics.html#topics10633) similar to [Earth's jet stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream).
