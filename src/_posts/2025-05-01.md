[The first](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111008.html) to orbit inner planet Mercury, the [MESSENGER](https://messenger.jhuapl.edu/index.html) spacecraft [came to rest](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19444) on this region of Mercury's surface on April 30, 2015. Constructed from MESSENGER image and laser altimeter data, the projected scene looks north over the northeastern rim of the broad, lava filled [Shakespeare basin](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15388). The large, 48 kilometer (30 mile) wide crater Janacek is near the upper left edge. Terrain height is color coded with red regions about 3 kilometers above blue ones. [MESSENGER'S final orbit](https://messenger.jhuapl.edu/About/Mission-Timeline.html) was predicted to end near the center, with the spacecraft impacting the surface at nearly 4 kilometers per second (over 8,700 miles per hour) and creating a new crater about 16 meters (52 feet) in diameter. The impact on the far side of Mercury was not observed by telescopes, but confirmed when no signal was detected from the spacecraft given time to emerge from behind the planet. Launched in 2004, the _ME_rcury _S_urface, _S_pace _EN_vironment, _GE_ochemisty and _R_anging spacecraft completed over 4,000 orbits after reaching the [Solar System's innermost planet](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Mercury) in 2011.
