Here comes Jupiter. [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s robotic spacecraft [Juno](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno/) is continuing on its highly [elongated orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit) around our Solar System's largest planet. The featured video is from perijove 11 in early 2018, the eleventh time [Juno](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/spacecraft/) passed near Jupiter since it arrived in mid-2016. This time-lapse, color-enhanced movie covers about four hours and morphs between 36 JunoCam images. [The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04Ai5evtWEc) begins with Jupiter rising as [Juno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_\(spacecraft\)) [approaches](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170523.html) from the north. As Juno reaches its closest view -- from about 3,500 kilometers [over Jupiter's cloud tops](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190205.html) -- the spacecraft captures the great planet in tremendous detail. [Juno](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/) passes light zones and dark belts of clouds that circle the planet, as well as numerous swirling circular storms, many of which are larger than [hurricanes on Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171127.html). After the perijove, [Jupiter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220720.html) recedes into the distance, then displaying the unusual clouds that appear over Jupiter's south. To get desired [science data](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/a-whole-new-jupiter-first-science-results-from-nasas-juno-mission/), Juno swoops so close to [Jupiter](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/) that its instruments are exposed to [very high levels](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/portrait-of-a-frightened-cat-closeup-breed-scottish-fold-picture-id614606664?k=20&m=614606664&s=612x612&w=0&h=KAn_QmEHFHxk8IvqySBkr6FfTYxVFVwq4kkwSnRJTTU=) of radiation.
