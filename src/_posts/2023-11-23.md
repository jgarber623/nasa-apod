The cosmic brush of star formation composed [this interstellar canvas](https://www.flickr.com/photos/150464529@N03/53336219347/) of emission, dust, and dark nebulae. A 5 degree wide telescopic mosaic, it frames a region found north of bright star Aldebaran on the sky, at an inner wall of [the local bubble](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/1000-light-year-bubble-is-the-source-of-all-nearby-baby-stars/?utm_source=cc&utm_medium=newsletter) along the [Taurus molecular cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111117.html). At lower left, emission cataloged as [Sh2-239](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111208.html) shows signs of embedded young stellar objects. The region's Herbig-Haro objects, nebulosities associated with newly born stars, are marked by tell-tale reddish jets of shocked hydrogen gas. Above and right T Tauri, the prototype of the class of [T Tauri variable stars](https://www.aavso.org/vsots_ttau), is next to a yellowish nebula historically known as Hind's Variable Nebula ([NGC 1555](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220210.html)). T Tauri stars are now generally recognized as young, less than a few million years old, sun-like stars still in the early [stages of formation](https://universe.nasa.gov/stars/basics/).
