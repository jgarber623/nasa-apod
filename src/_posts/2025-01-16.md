Beautiful and bright [spiral galaxy M83](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-83/) lies a some twelve million light-years away, near the southeastern tip of the very long constellation [Hydra](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/hya/index.html). Prominent spiral arms traced by dark dust lanes and blue star clusters lend this galaxy its popular name, The Southern Pinwheel. Still, reddish [star forming regions](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061123.html) that dot this cosmic pinwheel's spiral arms have suggested another nickname, the [Thousand-Ruby Galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190629.html). A mere 40,000 light-years across, smaller than the Milky Way, M83 is a member of a group of galaxies that includes active galaxy [Centaurus A](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080110.html). In fact, the core of M83 itself is bright [at x-ray energies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030206.html), showing a high concentration of neutron stars and black holes left from an intense burst of star formation. [This sharp color image](https://noirlab.edu/public/news/noirlab2429/) also features spiky foreground Milky Way stars and distant background galaxies. The image data was captured with the [Dark Energy Camera](https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/ctio/victor-blanco-4m-telescope/decam/) and Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory.
