What's the closest [active galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080110.html) to planet Earth? That would be [Centaurus A](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230503.html), cataloged as NGC 5128, which is only 12 million [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/)s distant. Forged in a collision of two otherwise normal galaxies, [Centaurus A](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/) shows several distinctive features including a [dark dust lane](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220317.html) across its center, [outer shells](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120701.html) of stars and gas, and [jets of particles](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210804.html) shooting out from a [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole) at its center. The [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/full/ssfh13/0/) captures all of these in a [composite series](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1040566871414338) of [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) images totaling over 310 hours captured over the past 10 years with a homebuilt telescope operating in [Auckland](https://youtu.be/Jbdf-Nm3F9I), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). The brightness of Cen A's center from low-energy [radio waves](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves/) to high-energy [gamma](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/12_gammarays/) rays [underlies](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Ft3tivrhnqsv61.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De142e081803e2344e4ded9030fcc4eab90d25aad) its designation as an [active galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus).
