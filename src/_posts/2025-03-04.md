Why does this Moon look so unusual? A key reason is its vivid [red](https://preview.colorkit.co/color/FF0000.png) color. The color is [caused](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/optical-effects/why-is-the-sunset-red) by the deflection of blue light by [Earth's atmosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-atmosphere/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/) -- the same reason that the [daytime sky appears blue](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/). The Moon also appears unusually [distorted](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231009.html). Its [strange structuring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170120.html) is an optical effect arising from layers in the Earth's atmosphere that [refract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction) light differently due to sudden differences in temperature or pressure. A third reason the Moon looks so unusual is that there is, by chance, an [airplane flying in front](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190212.html). The [featured](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGS3o0JtoBA/) picturesque [gibbous](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231112.html) [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/moon-phases/) was captured about two weeks ago above [Turin](https://youtu.be/5KIl4bpaDBM), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). Our familiar hovering sky orb was part of an unusual [quadruple alignment](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/c1/df/9e/c1df9e537650977b9474b103f380094b.jpg) that included two historic ground structures: the [Sacra di San Michele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacra_di_San_Michele) on the near hill and [Basilica of Superga](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231225.html) just beyond.
