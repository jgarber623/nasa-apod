If you watch long enough, a comet will appear. Before then, you will see [our Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/planets/) from inside the orbit of [Mercury](https://science.nasa.gov/mercury/) as recorded by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s [Parker Solar Probe](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/) looping around the [Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231119.html). The video captures coronal streamers into the [solar wind](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/what-is-the-solar-wind/), a small [Coronal Mass Ejection](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000309.html), and planets including, in order of appearance, [Mercury](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190428.html), [Venus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210317.html), [Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn), [Earth](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/), [Mars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161005.html), and [Jupiter](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/). Between the emergence of Earth and Mars, [Comet Tempel 1](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110216.html) appears with a distinctive tail. The continuous fleeting streaks are [high energy particles from the Sun](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/s/Solar+Cosmic+Rays) impacting Parker's sideways looking [camera](https://wispr.nrl.navy.mil/). The [featured time-lapse video](https://wispr.nrl.navy.mil/wisprdata) was taken last year during [Encounter 21](https://blogs.nasa.gov/parkersolarprobe/2024/10/03/parker-solar-probe-completes-21st-close-approach-to-the-sun/), Parker's 21st close approach to the Sun. [Studying](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/mmt7oo/gaming_cat_or_studying/#lightbox) data and images from [Parker](https://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/) are delivering a better understanding of the dynamic Sun's effects on Earth's [space weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather) as [well as](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/sun-space-weather/what-space-weather) humanity's power grids, spacecraft, and space-faring astronauts.
