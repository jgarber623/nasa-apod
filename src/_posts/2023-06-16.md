[This serene view from](https://vimeo.com/834367421) the coast of Sweden looks across the Baltic sea and compresses time, presenting the passage of one night in a single photograph. From sunset to sunrise, [moonlight](https://www.sternstunden.net/moonlight.html) illuminates the creative sea and skyscape. Fleeting clouds, fixed stars, and flowing [northern lights](https://www.sternstunden.net/moonlight.html) leave their traces in [planet Earth's sky](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/). To construct the timelapse image, 3296 video frames were recorded on the night of June's Full Moon between 7:04pm and 6:35am local time. [As time progresses](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2306/baltic-sea-timelapse-image_with-timescale600.jpg) from left to right, a single column of pixels was taken from the corresponding individual frame and combined in sequence into a single digital image 3296 pixels wide.
