The surface of our Sun is constantly changing. Some years it is quiet, showing relatively few sunspots and active regions. Other years it is churning, showing many [sunspot](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230517.html)s and throwing frequent [Coronal Mass Ejections](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/what-coronal-mass-ejection-or-cme/) (CMEs) and [flare](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180902.html)s. Reacting to [magnetism](https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-understanding-the-magnetic-sun/), our Sun's surface goes through periods of relative calm, called Solar Minimum and relative unrest, called Solar Maximum, every 11 years. The [featured video](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13714/) shows on the left a month in late 2019 when the [Sun](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/menu/sun/) was near [Solar Minimum](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191028.html), while on the right a month in 2014 when near [Solar Maximum](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap071203.html). The video was taken by NASA's [Solar Dynamic Observatory](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) in far [ultraviolet](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/) light. Our [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) is progressing again toward [Solar Maximum](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/solar-cycle-25-is-here-nasa-noaa-scientists-explain-what-that-means/) in 2025, but displaying even now a surface with a [surprisingly](https://images.pexels.com/photos/7140633/pexels-photo-7140633.jpeg) high amount of activity.
