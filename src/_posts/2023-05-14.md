What would it be like to fly free in space? At about 100 meters from the cargo bay of the [space shuttle Challenger](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap950809.html), Bruce McCandless II was living the dream -- floating farther out than anyone had ever been before. Guided by a [Manned Maneuvering Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Maneuvering_Unit) (MMU), astronaut McCandless, [pictured](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/nasa-celebrates-50-years-of-spacewalking), was [floating free](https://youtu.be/RvnC--JjDBw) in space. During [Space Shuttle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990411.html) mission [41-B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-41-B) in [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four), [McCandless](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/astronaut-bruce-mccandless-ii-dies-at-80) and fellow [NASA astronaut](https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts) [Robert Stewart](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/stewart_robert.pdf) were the first to [experience](https://youtu.be/7K5DiKsZhTk) such an "un[tether](http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wtether.html)ed [space walk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990801.html)". The [MMU](https://youtu.be/92ZRVlKuc0U) worked by shooting jets of [nitrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/7.shtml) and was used to help deploy and [retrieve satellites](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121209.html). With a mass over 140 kilograms, an [MMU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Maneuvering_Unit) is heavy on [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html), but, like everything, is weightless when drifting in orbit. The MMU was later replaced with the [SAFER](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011002.html) backpack propulsion unit.
