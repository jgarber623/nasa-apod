A waxing crescent Moon and a waning crescent Venus are found at opposite corners of this twilight [telephoto field of view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/akleiman/54301840864/). The close conjunction of the two brightest celestial beacons [in planet Earth's](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/whats-up-february-2025-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/) western evening sky was captured on February 1 from Rosario, Argentina. On that date, the slender crescent Moon was about 3 days old. But the Moon's visible sunlit crescent will grow to a bright Full Moon by February 14. Like the Moon, [Venus cycles through](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/venus-brightest-greatest-brilliancy-greatest-illuminated-extent-2/) phases as it orbits the Sun. And while its visible sunlit crescent narrows, the inner planet's apparent size increases as it gets closer to Earth. In a Valentine from the Solar System, Venus, named for the Roman goddess of Love, will also reach its peak brightness in planet Earth's evening skies around [February 14.](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/venus-brightest-greatest-brilliancy-greatest-illuminated-extent-2/)
