Only Mercury is missing from a [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/) parade of planets in this [early evening skyscape](https://www.dariogiannobile.com/night_sky_galleries/nightscape/hf97ff13#hf97ff13). Rising nearly opposite the Sun, bright Mars is at the far left. The other naked-eye planets Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus, can also be spotted, with the the position of too-faint Uranus and Neptune marked near the arcing trace of the [ecliptic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic). On the far right and close to the western horizon after sunset is a young crescent Moon whose surface is partly illuminated by earthshine. In the foreground of the composite panorama captured on 2 January, planet Earth is represented by Mount Etna's lower [Silvestri Crater](https://epod.usra.edu/blog/2024/06/walking-through-the-colors-on-a-crater.html). Of course Earth's early evening skies are [full of planets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220701.html) for the entire [month of January](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/whats-up-january-2025-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/). On 13 January, a nearly Full Moon will appear to pass in front of Mars for skywatchers in the continental U.S. and Eastern Canada.
