A familiar sight from Georgia, USA, the Moon sets near the western horizon in this rural night skyscape. [Captured on May 10](https://www.instagram.com/wrightdobbs/p/C63j2QrrYSJ/) before local midnight, the image overexposes the Moon's bright waning crescent at left in the frame. A long irrigation rig stretches across farmland about 15 miles north of the city of Bainbridge. [Shimmering curtains of aurora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt_XvnVrDco) shine across the starry sky though, definitely an unfamiliar sight for southern Georgia nights. Last weekend, extreme geomagnetic storms triggered by the recent intense activity from solar active region [AR 3664](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240515.html) brought [epic displays of aurora](https://www.facebook.com/media/set?set=a.431368006258449&type=3), usually seen closer to the poles, to southern Georgia and even lower latitudes on planet Earth. [As solar activity](https://blogs.nasa.gov/solarcycle25/) ramps up, more storms are possible.
