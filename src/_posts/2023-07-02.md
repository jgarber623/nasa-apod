It was one of the better skies of this long night. In parts of [Antarctica](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-antarctica-58.html), not only is it winter, but the Sun can spend weeks below the horizon. At [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China)'s [Zhongshan Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongshan_Station_(Antarctica)), people sometimes venture out into the cold to photograph a spectacular night sky. The featured image from one such outing was taken in mid-July of 2015, [just before the end](https://dateandtime.info/citysunrisesunset.php?id=6620792) of this [polar night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_night). Pointing up, the [wide angle lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-angle_lens) captured not only the ground at the bottom, but at the top as well. In the foreground, a colleague is taking pictures. In the distance, a spherical satellite receiver and several [windmills](https://energy.gov/eere/wind/how-do-wind-turbines-work) are visible. Numerous stars dot the night sky, including [Sirius](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/sirius.html) and [Canopus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100514.html). Far in the background, [stretching](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/175194979/photo/big-stretch.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=1DMdAkJMllfbCuwlN0OdD1vWbsz-kdD-PloadnaPDwY=) overhead from horizon to horizon, is the [central band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110710.html) of our [Milky Way Galaxy](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/milkyway.html). Even further in the distance, visible as extended smudges near the top, are the [Large](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130528.html) and [Small](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100903.html) Magellanic [Clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140916.html), satellite galaxies near our huge [Milky Way Galaxy](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cosmic/milkyway_info.html).
