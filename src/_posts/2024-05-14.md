For the mostly harmless denizens of planet Earth, the brighter stars of open cluster [NGC 2169](https://webda.physics.muni.cz/cgi-bin/ocl_page.cgi?dirname=ngc2169) seem to form a cosmic [37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/37_(number)). Did you expect [42](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_Puzzle)? From our perspective, the improbable numerical [asterism](http://www.seds.org/Maps/Const/asterism.html) appears solely by chance. It lies at an estimated distance of 3,300 light-years toward the [constellation Orion](http://www.gb.nrao.edu/~rmaddale/Education/OrionTourCenter/). As far as galactic or open star clusters go, NGC 2169 is a small one, spanning about 7 light-years. Formed at the same time from the same cloud of dust and gas, [the stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/) of NGC 2169 are only about 11 million years old. Such [clusters are](http://www.seasky.org/cosmic/sky7a06.html) expected to disperse over time as they encounter other stars, interstellar clouds, and experience gravitational tides while hitchhiking [through](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cluster#Eventual_fate) [the galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/galaxies/). Over four billion years ago, our own Sun was likely formed in a similar [open cluster of stars](http://www.seds.org/messier/open.html).
