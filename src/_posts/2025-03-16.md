This was a very unusual type of solar eclipse. Typically, it is the [Earth's Moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) that [eclipses](http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/SolarEclipsesGoogleMaps.html) the Sun. In 2012, though, the planet [Venus](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/in-depth/) took a turn. Like a [solar eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121117.html) by the Moon, the [phase of Venus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240108.html) became a continually thinner [crescent](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210725.html) as Venus became increasingly better [aligned](https://www.lifewithcats.tv/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/yhkjnmkjhgfdge.jpg) with the Sun. Eventually the alignment became perfect and the [phase](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/moon-phases/) of Venus dropped to zero. The [dark spot](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120611.html) of Venus crossed our parent star. The situation could technically be labeled a Venusian [annular eclipse](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-an-eclipse-58) with an extraordinarily large [ring of fire](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200615.html). [Pictured here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pldove/7344307970/in/photostream/) during the occultation, the Sun was imaged in three colors of [ultraviolet light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) by the Earth-orbiting [Solar Dynamics Observatory](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/), with the dark region toward the right corresponding to a [coronal hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100828.html). Hours later, as Venus continued in its orbit, a [slight crescent phase](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130814.html) appeared again. The next [Venusian transit across the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus#Past_and_future_transits) will occur in [2117](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22nd_century#Transits_and_occultations).
