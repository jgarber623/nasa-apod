In an interplanetary first, on July 19, 2013 Earth was photographed on the same day from two other worlds of the Solar System, innermost planet Mercury and ringed gas giant Saturn. [Pictured](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17038) on the left, Earth is the [pale blue dot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_blue_dot) just below the rings of Saturn, as captured by the robotic [Cassini spacecraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens) then orbiting the [outermost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant) gas giant. On that same day people across [planet Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100713.html) snapped many [of their own](http://www.flickr.com/groups/wave_at_saturn/pool/) pictures of Saturn. On the right, the [Earth-Moon system](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130722.html) is seen against the dark background of space as captured by the sunward [MESSENGER spacecraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER), then in Mercury orbit. MESSENGER took its image as part of a search for small natural satellites of Mercury, moons that would be expected to be quite dim. In the [MESSENGER image](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100901.html), the brighter Earth and Moon are both overexposed and shine brightly with reflected sunlight. Destined not to return to their home world, both [Cassini](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/main/index.html) and [MESSENGER](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/messenger) have since retired from their missions of Solar System exploration.
