How bright and strange will the tails of Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS become? [The comet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241007.html) has brightened dramatically over the few weeks as it passed its closest to [the Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) and, just three days ago, passed its closest to the Earth. [C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshanâ€“ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_\(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS\)) became of the [brightest comets](https://www.cometwatch.co.uk/brightest-comets-through-history/) of the past century over the past few days, but was unfortunately hard to see because it was so nearly superposed on the Sun. As [the comet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240925.html) appears to move away from the Sun, it is becoming a [remarkable sight](https://www.seadna.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hilariously-Surprised-Dogs.jpg) -- but may soon begin to fade. The [featured animated video](https://hdr-astrophotography.com/comet-tails-simulations/) shows how the comet's tails have developed, as viewed from Earth, and gives one prediction about how they might further develop. As shown in the video, heavier parts of the [dust tail](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/c/Cometary+Dust+Tail) that trails the comet have begun to appear to point in [nearly the opposite direction](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090225.html) from lighter parts of the dust tail as well as the comet's [ion tail](http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/tail.html), the blue tail that is pushed directly out from the Sun by the [solar wind](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-solar-wind-across-our-solar-system/).
