What's happening at the center of the Trifid Nebula? Three prominent [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html) lanes that give the [Trifid](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110513.html) its name all come together. [Mountains](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201222.html) of opaque dust appear near the bottom, while other dark filaments of dust are visible threaded throughout the nebula. A [single massive star](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...562..446R/abstract) visible near the center causes much of the [Trifid's glow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap980828.html). The Trifid, cataloged as [M20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifid_Nebula), is only about 300,000 years old, making it among the youngest [emission nebulas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/emission_nebulae.html) known. [The star forming nebula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe3lYHcmbEI) lies about 9,000 [light years](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html) away toward the [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/en/) of the Archer ([Sagittarius](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/sagittarius.html)). The region pictured here [spans](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1170788685/photo/jumping-cat.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=_Ot_m-qULa-AS2ueDMH8Qc4vu8jdsNso2hzIxsVGjTw=) about 20 light years.
