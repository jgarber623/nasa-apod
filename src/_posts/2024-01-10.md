[This colorful skyscape](https://www.astrobin.com/1cl7wp/) spans about three full moons across nebula rich starfields along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy toward the royal northern constellation [Cepheus](http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/star-errai-future-north-star). Near the edge of the region's massive molecular cloud some 2,400 light-years away, bright reddish emission region [Sharpless](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1953ApJ...118..362S) (Sh)2-155 is at the center of the frame, also known as the [Cave Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170323.html). About 10 light-years across the cosmic cave's bright walls of gas are ionized by ultraviolet light from the hot young stars around it. Dusty bluish reflection nebulae, [like vdB](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1966AJ.....71..990V) 155 at the left, and dense obscuring clouds of dust also abound on the interstellar canvas. Astronomical [explorations](https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5326) have revealed other [dramatic signs of star formation](https://hubblesite.org/hubble-30th-anniversary/hubbles-exciting-universe/beholding-the-birth-and-death-of-stars), including the bright reddish fleck of [Herbig-Haro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbig%E2%80%93Haro_object) (HH) 168. At the upper left in the frame, the Herbig-Haro object emission is generated by energetic jets from a [newborn star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221118.html).
