Large galaxies grow by eating small ones. [Even our own](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050529.html) galaxy engages in a sort of galactic [cannibalism](http://www.cosmotography.com/images/galaxy_cannibalism.html), absorbing small galaxies that are too close and are [captured](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407566) by the Milky Way's gravity. In fact, the [practice is common](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2017/hubble-catches-a-galaxy-duo-by-the-hare) in the universe and illustrated by this striking pair of interacting galaxies from the banks of the southern constellation [Eridanus](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/eri/index.html), [The River](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160102.html). Located over 50 million light years away, the large, distorted spiral NGC 1532 is seen locked in a gravitational struggle with dwarf galaxy NGC 1531, a struggle the smaller galaxy [will eventually lose](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080619.html). Seen nearly edge-on, spiral NGC 1532 spans about 100,000 light-years. [The merging galaxies are captured](https://noirlab.edu/public/news/noirlab2321/) in this sharp image from the Dark Energy Camera mounted on the National Science Foundation’s Blanco 4-meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The NGC 1532/1531 pair is thought to be similar to the well-studied system of face-on spiral and small companion [known as M51](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220902.html).
