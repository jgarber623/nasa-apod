Cosmic clouds form [fantastic shapes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100716.html) in the central regions of emission nebula IC 1805. The clouds are sculpted by stellar winds and radiation from massive hot stars in the nebula's [newborn](http://chandra.harvard.edu/edu/formal/stellar_ev/story/index9.html) star cluster, [Melotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melotte_catalogue) 15. About 1.5 million years young, the cluster stars are scattered in this [colorful skyscape](https://www.astrobin.com/fokpl4/), along with [dark dust clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240822.html) in silhouette against glowing atomic gas. A composite of narrowband and broadband telescopic images, the view spans about 15 light-years and includes emission from ionized [hydrogen](https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2016/ps_5.html), [sulfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur), and [oxygen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml) atoms mapped to green, red, and blue hues in the popular [Hubble Palette](https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/astrophotography/astrophoto-tips/create-hubble-palette-astro-images-astro-pixel-processor). [Wider field](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220214.html) images reveal that IC 1805's simpler, overall outline suggests its popular name - the [Heart Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190911.html). IC 1805 is located about 7,500 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) away toward the [boastful](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/159176199/photo/cat.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=U34AGa5EN0xuBbrzpSygVHcR7RHuwWAivyH7hpHw_m0=) constellation [Cassiopeia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_%28constellation%29).
