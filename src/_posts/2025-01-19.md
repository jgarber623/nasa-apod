What would it look like to land on Saturn's moon Titan? The [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int/)'s Huygens probe set down on the Solar System's cloudiest moon in 2005, and a [time-lapse video](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08118) of its descent images was created. [Huygens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens_%28spacecraft%29) separated from the robotic [Cassini spacecraft](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/spacecraft/cassini-orbiter/) soon after it achieved orbit around Saturn in late 2004 and began approaching [Titan](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/moons/titan/). For two hours after arriving, Huygens plummeted toward [Titan](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap041028.html)'s surface, recording at first only the shrouded moon's opaque atmosphere. The computerized [truck-tire sized probe](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cassini-Huygens/Huygens_spacecraft) soon deployed a parachute to slow its descent, pierced the thick clouds, and began transmitting images of a [strange surface](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050117.html) far below [never before seen](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1128004359/photo/close-up-scottish-fold-cat-head-with-shocking-face-and-wide-open-eyes-frighten-or-surprised.jpg?s=170667a&w=0&k=20&c=0x_xd9aj8iHg0vn-DHE9OJdjKyeOI6tDWWmqt91MteU=) in [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/). Landing in a [dried sea](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070207.html) and [surviving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens) for 90 minutes, Huygen's returned unique images of a [strange plain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDygi63Opr8) of dark sandy soil strewn with smooth, bright, fist-sized rocks of ice.
