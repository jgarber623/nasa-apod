[Massive stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution#Massive_stars) in our Milky Way Galaxy live spectacular lives. Collapsing from vast cosmic clouds, their nuclear furnaces ignite and create heavy elements in their cores. After only a few million years for the most massive stars, the [enriched material](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190801.html) is blasted back into interstellar space where star formation can begin anew. The expanding debris cloud known as Cassiopeia A is an example of this final phase of the [stellar life cycle](https://universe.nasa.gov/stars/basics/). Light from the supernova explosion that created this remnant would have been first [seen in planet Earth's sky](https://spider.seds.org/spider/Vars/casA.html) about 350 years ago, although it took that light 11,000 years to reach us. [This sharp NIRCam image](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2023/149/01HGGZ4TPD8XFNPCBTZ2QYM0ZM) from the James Webb Space Telescope shows the still hot filaments and knots in the supernova remnant. The whitish, smoke-like outer shell of the expanding blast wave is about 20 light-years across. A series of light echoes from the massive star's cataclysmic explosion are also [identified in Webb's detailed images](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/nasas-webb-reveals-intricate-layers-of-interstellar-dust-gas/) of the surrounding interstellar medium.
