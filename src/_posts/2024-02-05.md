What's happening in the core of the Carina Nebula? Stars are forming, dying, and leaving an [impressive tapestry](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100322.html) of dark dusty filaments. The entire [Carina Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula), cataloged as NGC 3372, spans over 300 [light years](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) and lies about 8,500 light-years away in the [constellation](http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales3.htm) of Carina. The nebula is composed predominantly of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) gas, which [emits the pervasive red and orange glows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha) seen mostly in the center of this [highly detailed](https://www.astrobin.com/8ap2rm/) [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2e89rZJ2VX/). The blue glow around the edges is [created primarily](https://remoteastrophotography.com/2023/01/foraxx-palette-script-dynamic-narrowband-combinations) by a trace amount of glowing [oxygen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml). [Young](https://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-85123446-scaled.jpg) and massive stars located in the nebula's center [expel dust](https://herscheltelescope.org.uk/science/infrared/dust/) when they explode in supernovas. [Eta Carinae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Carinae), the most energetic star in the nebula's center, was one of the brightest stars in the sky in the 1830s, but then [faded dramatically](https://www.aavso.org/vsots_etacar).
