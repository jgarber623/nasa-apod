High-speed outflows of molecular gas from a pair of actively forming young stars shine in infrared light, revealing themselves in [this NIRcam image](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2023/131/01H53089T1FMZZN48VD4Z73FRC) from the James Webb Space Telescope. Cataloged as HH (Herbig-Haro) 46/47, the young stars are [lodged within a dark nebula](https://www.eso.org/public/ireland/images/eso1336c/) that is largely opaque when viewed in visible light. The pair lie at the center of the prominent reddish [diffraction spikes](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN) in the NIRcam image. Their [energetic stellar jets](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2018/53/4266-Image?Tag=Stellar%20Jets) extend for nearly a light-year, [burrowing into](https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/image/ssc2003-06f-embedded-outflow-in-hh-46-47) the dark interstellar material. A tantalizing object to explore with Webb's infrared capabilities, this [young star system](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0304258) is relatively nearby, located only some 1,140 light-years distant in the nautical [constellation Vela](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/vel/index.html).
