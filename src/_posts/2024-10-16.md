Thin green aurora are visible toward the top of the frame. In the background one can find the Moon, the LMC, SMC, Venus, a meteor, and the band of our Milky Way galaxy.

Sometimes the night sky is full of surprises. Take the sky over [Lindis Pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESvSl7eIEes), [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) one-night last week. Instead of a typically [calm night sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220910.html) filled with constant [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/), a busy and [dynamic night sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241013.html) appeared. Suddenly visible were pervasive [red aurora](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240512.html), green [picket-fence aurora](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080101.html), a [red SAR arc](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231111.html), a [STEVE](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230927.html), a [meteor](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240814.html), and the [Moon](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5187/). These outshone the center of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) and both of its two satellite galaxies: the [LMC](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241002.html) and [SMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Magellanic_Cloud). All of these were captured together on 28 exposures in five minutes, from which this panorama was composed. Auroras [lit up](https://delavanlakesvet.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/195/2022/03/smiling-cat-for-web.jpg) many skies last week, as a [Coronal Mass Ejection](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/11298/) from the Sun unleashed a burst of particles toward our Earth that created colorful skies over [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude)s usually too far from the Earth's poles to see them. More generally, night skies this month have other surprises, showing not only auroras -- but [comet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241007.html)[s](https://earthsky.org/space/sungrazer-comet-bright-daytime-a11bp7i/).
