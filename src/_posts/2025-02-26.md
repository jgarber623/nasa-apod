Do you see the ring? If you look very closely at the center of the featured galaxy [NGC 6505](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_6505), a ring becomes evident. It is the gravity of [NGC 6505](https://www.euclid-ec.org/einstein-ring-in-ngc-6505/), the nearby ([z](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-behind-the-discoveries/hubble-cosmological-redshift/) = 0.042) [elliptical galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy) that you can easily see, that is [magnifying and distorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/spff2s/psbattle_this_dog_staring_at_the_camera/#lightbox) the image of a [distant galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210802.html) into a complete circle. To create a complete [Einstein ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111221.html) there must be perfect alignment of the nearby galaxy's center and part of the background galaxy. [Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06505) of this ring and the multiple images of the background galaxy help to determine the mass and fraction of [dark matter](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/dark-matter-dark-energy/) in NGC 6505's center, as well as uncover previously [unseen details](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220705.html) in the distorted galaxy. The [featured image](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/euclid-discovers-einstein-ring-in-our-cosmic-backyard/) was captured by [ESA](https://www.esa.int/)'s Earth-orbiting [Euclid telescope](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid_overview) in 2023 and released earlier this month.
