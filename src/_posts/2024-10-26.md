These brightly outlined flowing shapes look ghostly on a cosmic scale. [A telescopic view](https://www.astrobin.com/18dwm3/) toward the constellation [Cassiopeia](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160318.html), the colorful skyscape features the swept-back, comet-shaped clouds IC 59 (left) and IC 63. About 600 light-years distant, [the clouds](http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/129/2/954) aren't actually ghosts. They are slowly disappearing though, under the influence of [energetic radiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01419) from hot, luminous star gamma Cas. [Gamma Cas](https://www.aavso.org/vsots_gammacas) is physically located only 3 to 4 light-years from the nebulae and lies just above the right edge of the frame. Slightly closer to gamma Cas, IC 63 is dominated by [red H-alpha light emitted](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111013.html) as hydrogen atoms ionized by the hot star's ultraviolet radiation recombine with electrons. Farther from the star, IC 59 shows less H-alpha emission but more of the characteristic blue tint of dust [reflected star light](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap091126.html). The field of view spans over 1 degree or 10 light-years at the estimated distance of [the interstellar apparitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04313).
