This galaxy is unusual for how many stars it seems that you can see. [Stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/) are so abundantly evident in this deep exposure of the spiral galaxy NGC 300 because so many of these stars are [bright blue and grouped](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221205.html) into resolvable bright star clusters. Additionally, [NGC 300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_300) is so clear because it is one of the closest [spiral galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy) to Earth, as light takes only about 6 million years to get here. Of course, galaxies are composed of many more [faint stars](https://www.reddit.com/r/askastronomy/comments/1g8ftr0/from_the_perspective_of_other_stars_in_the_milky/) than bright, and even more of a galaxy's mass is attributed to unseen [dark matter](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/dark-matter/). [NGC 300](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap020821.html) spans nearly the same amount of sky as the [full moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240915.html) and is visible with a small telescope toward the southern constellation of the [Sculptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculptor_\(constellation\)). The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DChWdQOOQzR/) was captured in October from [Rio Hurtado](https://youtu.be/a5jUyVPIDAk), [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile) and is a [composite](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhat-do-you-call-a-pile-of-kittens-a-meowntain-our-11yo-v0-5u4lbl0trml81.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D256b968c218e77e5edd1aece91ae1182c7eb6abb) of over 20 hours of exposure.
