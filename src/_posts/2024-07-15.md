Why does this galaxy have such a long tail? In this stunning vista, based on image data from the [Hubble Legacy Archive](https://hla.stsci.edu/), distant galaxies form a dramatic backdrop for disrupted spiral [galaxy Arp](http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/frames.html) 188, the Tadpole Galaxy. The [cosmic tadpole](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2002/11/1181-Image.html) is a mere 420 million light-years distant toward the northern constellation of the Dragon ([Draco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_\(constellation\))). Its [eye-catching](https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad12683c000032000b0e42.jpeg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale) tail is about 280 thousand [light-year](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/)s long and features massive, bright blue star clusters. One [story](http://www.boop.org/jan/justso/) goes that a more compact intruder galaxy crossed in front of [Arp 188](https://www.astrobin.com/6odbgy/G/) - from right to left in this view - and was [slung around](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150201.html) behind the [Tadpole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadpole_Galaxy) by their gravitational attraction. During the [close encounter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120812.html), tidal forces drew out the [spiral galaxy's](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120604.html) stars, gas, and dust forming the spectacular tail. The [intruder](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970224.html) galaxy itself, estimated to lie about 300 thousand light-years behind the Tadpole, can be seen through foreground spiral arms at the upper right. [Following](https://annex.exploratorium.edu/frogs/) its terrestrial [namesake](http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/metindex.htm), the [Tadpole Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadpole_Galaxy) will likely lose [its tail](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...178..623T/abstract) as it grows older, the tail's star clusters forming smaller satellites of the large spiral galaxy.
