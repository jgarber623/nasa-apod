This floating ring is the size of a galaxy. In fact, it is a galaxy -- or at least part of one: the photogenic [Sombrero Galaxy](http://messier.seds.org/m/m104.html), one of the largest galaxies in the nearby [Virgo Cluster of Galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050213.html). The dark band of [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html) that obscures the mid-section of the [Sombrero Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sombrero_galaxy) in optical light actually glows brightly in infrared light. The [featured image](https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/1419-ssc2005-11a-Spitzer-Spies-Spectacular-Sombrero), digitally sharpened, shows the [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) glow, recently recorded by the orbiting [Spitzer Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/main/index.html), superposed in false-color on an [existing](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210514.html) image taken by NASA's [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/about) in [visible](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight) light. The [Sombrero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sombrero) Galaxy, also known as [M104](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBB2xQe8nMw), spans about 50,000 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) across and lies 28 million light years away. [M104](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070505.html) can be seen with a small telescope in the direction of the constellation [Virgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(constellation)).
