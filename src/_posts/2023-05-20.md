Looping through the Jovian system in the late 1990s, the [Galileo spacecraft](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galileo/) recorded stunning views of Europa and uncovered evidence that the moon's icy surface likely hides a deep, global ocean. Galileo's Europa image data has been [remastered here](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/?IDNumber=PIA19048), with improved calibrations to produce a color image approximating what the human eye might see. Europa's long curving fractures [hint at the subsurface liquid water](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-scientists-confirm-water-vapor-on-europa). The tidal flexing [the large moon experiences](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160401.html) in its elliptical orbit around Jupiter supplies the energy to keep the ocean liquid. But more [tantalizing](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140919.html) is the possibility that even in the absence of sunlight that process could also supply the energy to support life, [making Europa](https://europa.nasa.gov/) one of the best places to look for life beyond Earth. What kind of life could thrive in a deep, dark, subsurface ocean? Consider planet Earth's own [extreme shrimp](https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/extreme-shrimp-may-hold-clues-to-alien-life/).
