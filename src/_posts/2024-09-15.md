Have you ever seen the Man in the Moon? This common question plays on the ability of humans to see [pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia) -- imagining familiar icons where they don't actually exist. The textured surface of Earth's [full Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240211.html) is home to numerous identifications of iconic objects, not only in modern western culture but in [world folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_Moon#/media/File:Man_In_The_Moon2.png) throughout history. Examples, typically dependent on [the Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/)'s perceived orientation, include the [Woman in the Moon](http://theketelsens.blogspot.com/2013/11/lunar-pareidolia-test.html) and the [Rabbit in the Moon](https://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/aztefacts/rabbit-in-the-moon). One [facial outline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_Moon#/media/File:Melies_color_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg) commonly identified as the [Man in the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_Moon) starts by imagining the two dark circular areas -- [lunar maria](https://moon.nasa.gov/observe-the-moon-night/resources/moon-map/) -- here just above [the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon#/media/File:Moon_names.svg)'s center, to be the eyes. Surprisingly, there [actually is](https://i.pinimg.com/550x/81/21/c0/8121c0291fa14d1fe52b9eb007741cac.jpg) a man in this Moon image -- a [close look](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140113.html) will reveal a real person -- with a telescope -- [silhouetted against the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211010.html). This well-planned image was taken in 2016 in [Cadalso de los Vidrios](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadalso_de_los_Vidrios) in [Madrid](https://youtu.be/LrshnxYuzNI), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain).
