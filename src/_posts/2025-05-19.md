What if you could fly over [Pluto](https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/)'s moon Charon -- what might you see? The New Horizons spacecraft did just this in 2015 July as it [zipped past Pluto](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250518.html) and [Charon](https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/moons/charon/) with cameras blazing. The images recorded allowed for a digital reconstruction of much of [Charon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_\(moon\))'s surface, further enabling the creation of fictitious flights over Charon created from this data. One such fanciful, minute-long, time-lapse video is [shown here](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/flyover-pluto-moon-charon/) with vertical heights and colors of surface features digitally enhanced. Your journey begins over a wide chasm that divides different types of [Charon's landscape](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151002.html)s, a chasm that might have formed when [Charon](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/pluto-s-big-moon-charon-reveals-a-colorful-and-violent-history) froze through. You soon turn [north](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200407.html) and fly over a colorful depression dubbed [Mordor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordor_Macula) that, one hypothesis holds, is an [unusual remnant](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/science/pluto-moon-charon.html) from an ancient impact. [Your voyage](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/964jz1/dog_surfing_on_a_wave_on_ocean_sea_on_summer/#lightbox) continues over an [alien landscape](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140826.html) rich with never-before-seen craters, mountains, and [crevice](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201129.html)s. The robotic [New Horizons spacecraft](https://www.nasa.gov/image/ames/take-new-horizons-for-a-spin-and-print-your-own-model) has too much [momentum](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Physics-Interactives/Momentum-and-Collisions/Collision-Carts/Collision-Carts-Interactive) to ever return to [Pluto](https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/facts/) and Charon and is now [headed out](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/new-horizons/nasas-new-horizons-to-continue-exploring-outer-solar-system/) of our [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/).
