[On March 14 the Full Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250315.html) slid through Earth's dark umbral shadow and denizens of planet Earth were treated to a total lunar [eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/eclipses/). Of course, from the Moon's near side that same astronomical [syzygy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_\(astronomy\)) was seen as a _solar_ eclipse. Operating in the Mare Crisium on [the lunar surface](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250303.html), the [Blue Ghost lander captured](https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/missions/2025/03/14/nasa-science-data-received-blue-ghost-captures-eclipse-from-moon/) this video frame of Earth in silhouette around 3:30am CDT, just as the Sun was emerging from behind the terrestrial disk. [From Blue Ghost's](https://fireflyspace.com/news/blue-ghost-mission-1-live-updates/) lunar perspective the beautiful [diamond ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240420.html) effect, familiar to earthbound solar eclipse watchers, is striking. Since Earth appears about four times the apparent size of the Sun from the lunar surface the inner [solar corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230516.html), the atmosphere of the Sun most easily seen from Earth during a total solar eclipse, is hidden from view. Still, scattering in Earth's dense atmosphere creates the glowing band of sunlight embracing [our fair planet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070302.html).
