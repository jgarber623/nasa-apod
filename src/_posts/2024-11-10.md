The largest canyon in the [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/) cuts a wide swath across the face of [Mars](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/). Named [Valles Marineris](https://youtu.be/JUbQM47QXwQ), the grand valley extends over 3,000 kilometers long, spans as much as 600 kilometers across, and delves as much as 8 kilometers deep. By comparison, the [Earth's Grand Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon) in Arizona, USA is 800 kilometers long, 30 kilometers across, and 1.8 kilometers deep. The origin of the [Valles Marineris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valles_Marineris) remains [unknown](https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/theevilliouschronicles/images/8/85/Confused-cat.jpg), although a leading hypothesis holds that it started as a [crack](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap980310.html) billions of years ago as the planet cooled. Several geologic processes have been identified in [the canyon](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/valles-marineris-the-grand-canyon-of-mars/). The [featured mosaic](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-mars.html) was [created](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/caption/marsglobe1.txt) from over 100 images of [Mars](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/facts/) taken by [Viking](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/viking/spacecraft-and-science/) Orbiters in the 1970s.
