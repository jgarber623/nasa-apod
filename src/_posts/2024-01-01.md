[Galaxies](https://pages.astronomy.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/) are fascinating not only for what is visible, but for what is invisible. [Grand spiral](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap961030.html) galaxy [NGC 1232](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997AAS...191.8203B/abstract), [captured](https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso9845d/) in detail by one of the [Very Large Telescopes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000707.html), is a good example. The visible is dominated by millions of [bright stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221205.html) and dark [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html), caught up in a gravitational swirl of spiral arms revolving about the center. [Open clusters](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/open_clusters.html) containing bright blue stars can be seen sprinkled along these spiral arms, while [dark lanes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap980116.html) of dense interstellar [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap001119.html) can be seen sprinkled between them. [Less visible](https://files.ctctcdn.com/3a7f39ae001/aedd7697-f09f-4b3a-8f7b-256d0a0389bc.jpg), but detectable, are billions of dim normal stars and vast tracts of [interstellar gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010113.html), together wielding such high mass that they dominate the dynamics of the inner [galaxy](https://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=18005). Leading theories indicate that even [greater amounts](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031231.html) of matter are invisible, in a form we don't yet know. This pervasive [dark matter](https://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/dark_matter.html) is postulated, in part, to explain the [motions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) of the visible matter in the outer regions of galaxies.
