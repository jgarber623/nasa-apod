Can a gas cloud eat a galaxy? It's not even close. The "claw" of this odd looking "creature" in the [featured photo](https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noirlab2412a/) is a gas cloud known as a [cometary globule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cometary_globule). This globule, however, [has ruptured](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995A%26A...293..493G/abstract). Cometary [globules](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221212.html) are typically characterized by [dusty](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/glossary.html#dust) heads and elongated [tails](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...463L.105M/abstract). These features cause cometary [globules](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120612.html) to have visual similarities to [comet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170409.html)s, but in reality they are very much different. [Globules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_nebula) are frequently the birthplaces of stars, and many show very young [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/) in their heads. The reason for the rupture in the head of [this object](https://noirlab.edu/public/news/noirlab2412/) is not yet known. The [galaxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy) to the left of the globule is huge, very far in the distance, and only placed near [CG4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CG_4) by [chance superposition](https://blogmais.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/imagem_ht_07-04-23.jpg).
