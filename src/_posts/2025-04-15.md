What happens when a star runs out of [nuclear fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion)? For stars like [our Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/), the center condenses into a [white dwarf](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000910.html) while the outer atmosphere is expelled into space to appear as a [planetary nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula). The expelled outer atmosphere of planetary nebula [NGC 1514](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1514) appears to be a [jumble of bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1514#/media/File:NGC_1514_by_Goran_Nilsson_&_The_Liverpool_Telescope.jpg) -- when seen in [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/). But the view from the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211226.html) in [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/), as [featured here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/54206737999/in/datetaken/), confirms a different story: [in this light](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....140.1882R/abstract) the nebula shows a distinct [hourglass shape](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190929.html), which is [interpreted](https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/1538-3881/140/6/1882/revision1/aj370110f9_lr.gif) as a [cylinder](https://www.geogebra.org/m/sdFGxeYM) seen along a diagonal. If you look closely at the center of the nebula, you can also see a [bright central star](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...829...73M/abstract) that is part of a [binary system](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970219.html). More observations might better reveal how this nebula is evolving and how the central stars are [working together](https://www.medivetgroup.com/globalassets/assets/advice-articles/multi-cat/two-cats-cleaning.jpg) to produce the interesting cylinder and bubbles observed.
