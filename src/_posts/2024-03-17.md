Is this galaxy jumping through a [giant ring of stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150419.html)? Probably not. Although the precise [dynamics behind](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...589..157S/abstract) the featured image is yet unclear, what is clear is that the pictured galaxy, [NGC 7714](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMIBcXo-oXo), has been stretched and distorted by a recent collision with a neighboring galaxy. This smaller neighbor, [NGC 7715](http://faculty.etsu.edu/smithbj/captions/n7714cap.html), situated off to the left of the frame, is thought to have [charged](https://live.staticflickr.com/5250/5228406300_27e05d74b7_b.jpg) right through [NGC 7714](https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1503/). Observations indicate that the golden [ring pictured](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rudypohl/32588157757/in/photostream/) is composed of millions of older Sun-like stars that are likely co-moving with the [interior bluer stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221205.html). In contrast, the bright center of [NGC 7714](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7714) appears to be undergoing a burst of new star formation. The [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/399094/J/?nc=user) was captured by the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/about-hubble/). NGC 7714 is located about 130 million [light years](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/faq/26/what-is-a-light-year/) away toward the constellation of the Two Fish ([Pisces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisces_(constellation))). The [interactions](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150212.html) between these galaxies likely started about 150 million [years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_natural_history) and should continue for several hundred million [years more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future), after which a [single central galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220606.html) may result.
