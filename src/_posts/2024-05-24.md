Star formation can be messy. To help find out just how messy, [ESA](https://www.esa.int/)'s new [Sun-orbiting](https://sci.esa.int/web/euclid/-/29537-the-second-lagrangian-point-l2) [Euclid telescope](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid) recently captured the most detailed image ever of the bright star forming region M78. Near the image center, [M78](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210121.html) lies at a distance of only about 1,300 [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/)s away and has a main glowing core that spans about 5 light-years. The [featured image](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2024/05/Euclid_s_new_image_of_star-forming_region_Messier_78) was taken in both [visible](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) and [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) light. The purple tint in [M78's center](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170124.html) is caused by dark [dust](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/D/Dust+Grain) preferentially [reflect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_nebula)ing the blue light of hot, young stars. Complex dust lanes and filaments can be traced through this [gorgeous and revealing](https://i.imgflip.com/eyvnj.jpg) skyscape. On the upper left is associated star forming region [NGC 2071](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_2071), while a third region of star formation is visible on the lower right. These nebulas are all part of the vast [Orion Molecular Cloud Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_molecular_cloud_complex) which can be found with even a small telescope [just north of Orion's belt](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150316.html).
