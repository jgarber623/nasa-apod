What’s that near the Moon? It’s the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html) (ISS). Although the [ISS](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151109.html) may appear to be physically near the [Moon](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/), it is not — it is physically near the [Earth](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/). In [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit) and circulating around our [big blue marble](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030426.html) about every 90 minutes, the ISS was captured photographically as it crossed nearly [in front of the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211206.html). The Moon, itself in a month-long orbit around the Earth, shows a crescent phase as only a curving sliver of its [Sun-illuminated half](https://i.redd.it/6ck58p1mkhf01.jpg) is visible from the Earth. The featured image was taken in late March from [Shanghai](https://youtu.be/5XEtBHYUPg4), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) and shows not only details of Earth's largest human-made satellite, but details of the cratered and [barren surface](https://www.salon.com/2014/07/09/buzz_aldrin_describes_the_magnificent_desolation_of_the_moon_and_other_fascinating_aspects_of_space_to_reddit/) of Earth's largest natural satellite. Over the next few years, humanity is planning to send [more people and machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_the_Moon#Future_missions) to the [Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221201.html) than ever before.
