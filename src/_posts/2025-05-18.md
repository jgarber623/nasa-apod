What if you could fly over [Pluto](https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/) -- what might you see? The [New Horizons](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/new-horizons/) spacecraft did just this in [2015 July](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150715.html) as it shot past the distant world at a speed of about 80,000 kilometers per hour. Images from this spectacular passage have been color enhanced, vertically scaled, and digitally combined into the [featured two-minute time-lapse video](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia21863-soaring-over-pluto/). As your [journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2HU3LGdbo) begins, light dawns on [mountains](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151214.html) thought to be composed of water ice but colored by frozen nitrogen. Soon, to your right, you see a [flat sea](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161122.html) of mostly [solid nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_nitrogen) that has segmented into strange polygons that are thought to have [bubbled up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JC1ijzmH3U) from a comparatively warm [interior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto#Internal_structure). Craters and ice mountains are [common sights](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sputnik_Planitia_nomenclature.png) below. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJzKDbnXyH0) dims and ends over terrain dubbed [bladed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160402.html) because it shows 500-meter high ridges separated by kilometer-sized gaps. The robotic [New Horizons spacecraft](https://www.nasa.gov/image/ames/take-new-horizons-for-a-spin-and-print-your-own-model) has too much [momentum](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Physics-Interactives/Momentum-and-Collisions/Collision-Carts/Collision-Carts-Interactive) to ever return to [Pluto](https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/facts/) and is now [headed out](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/new-horizons/nasas-new-horizons-to-continue-exploring-outer-solar-system/) of our [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/).
