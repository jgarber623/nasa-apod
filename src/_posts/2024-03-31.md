In late 2021 there was a total solar eclipse visible only at the end of the Earth. To capture the [unusual phenomenon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240310.html), airplanes took flight below the clouded seascape of [Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean). The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXETIsGFPMR/) shows one relatively spectacular capture where the bright spot is the outer [corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170920.html) of the Sun and the [eclipsing Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170820.html) is seen as the dark spot in the center. A wing and engine of the [airplane](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/UEET/StudentSite/airplanes.html) are visible across the left and bottom of the image, while [another airplane observing the eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130513.html) is visible on the far left. The dark area of the sky surrounding the [eclipsed Sun](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/eclipse-snap/) is called a [shadow cone](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100804.html). It is dark because you are looking down a [long corridor](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031127.html) of air shadowed by the Moon. A [careful inspection](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/705/995/a66.png) of the eclipsed Sun will reveal the [planet Mercury](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200708.html) just to the right. You won't have to travel to the end of the Earth to see the [next total solar eclipse](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2024-april-8). The total eclipse path will cross [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) on [2024 April 8](https://eclipse.aas.org/eclipse-america-2024), just over one week from today.
