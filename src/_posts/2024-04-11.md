Start at the upper left above and you can follow the progress of [April 8's](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/) total eclipse of the Sun in seven sharp, separate exposures. The image sequence was recorded with a telescope and camera located within the narrow path of totality as the [Moon's shadow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240324.html) swept across Newport, Vermont, USA. At center is a spectacular view of [the solar corona](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/corona.shtml). The tenuous outer atmosphere of the Sun is only easily visible to the eye in clear dark skies during the total eclipse phase. [Seen from Newport](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/in/usa/newport?iso=20240408), the total phase for this solar eclipse lasted about 3 minutes and 26 seconds.
