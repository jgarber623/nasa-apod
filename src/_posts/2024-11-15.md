Put on your [red/blue glasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D#/media/File:Anaglyph_glasses.png) and gaze across the western [Ocean of Storms](https://www.alanbeangallery.com/tiptoeing-on-the-ocean-of-storms) on the surface of the Moon. [The 3D anaglyph features](https://www.nasa.gov/history/alsj/a12/A12-Anaglyphs.html) Apollo 12 astronaut Pete Conrad [visiting the Surveyor 3](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181022.html) spacecraft in November of 1969. [Surveyor 3 had landed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990408.html) at the site on the inside slope of a small crater about 2 1/2 years earlier in April of 1967. Visible on the horizon beyond the far crater wall, Apollo 12's [Lunar Module Intrepid](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1969-099C) touched down less than 200 meters (650 feet) away, easy moonwalking distance from the robotic Surveyor spacecraft. This stereo image was carefully created from two separate pictures [(AS12-48-7133, AS12-48-7134)](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/images12.html#7133) captured on the [lunar surface](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/a12.html). They depict the scene from only slightly different viewpoints, approximating the separation between human eyes.
