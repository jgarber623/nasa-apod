In the fading darkness before dawn, a tilted triangle appeared to balance atop a [rock formation](https://youtu.be/NoMu4M8pJ0w) off the southern tip of [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily). Making up the points of the triangle are three of the four [brightest objects](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/what-are-the-brightest-objects-in-our-solar-system/) visible in Earth’s sky: [Jupiter](https://science.nasa.gov/Jupiter), [Venus](https://science.nasa.gov/venus) and the [Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html). Though a thin [waning crescent](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-phases/), most of the moon’s disk is visible due to [earthshine](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150320.html). Captured in this image on 2022 April 27, Venus (center) and Jupiter (left) are roughly three degrees apart -- and were headed toward a [close conjunction](https://earthsky.org/tonight/venus-and-jupiter-conjunction-april-30-may-1-2022/). [Conjunction](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/definition-conjunction-astronomy/)s of [Venus and Jupiter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230306.html) occur about once a year and are visible either in the east before sunrise or in the west after sunset. The [featured image](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3377689472488626&set=pb.100007428194796.-2207520000&type=3) was taken about an hour before the [arrival](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160926.html) of the [brightest object](https://i2.pickpik.com/photos/93/770/415/cat-surprised-big-eyes-eyes-preview.jpg) in Earth’s sky – [the Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/).
