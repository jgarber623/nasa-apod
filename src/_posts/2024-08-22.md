In silhouette against a crowded star field along the tail of the arachnological constellation [Scorpius](http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/sco/index.html), this dusty cosmic cloud evokes for some the image of an [ominous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childe_Roland_to_the_Dark_Tower_Came) dark tower. In fact, monstrous clumps of dust and molecular gas [collapsing](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210630.html) to form stars may well lurk within the dark nebula, a structure that spans almost 40 light-years across this [gorgeous telescopic portrait](https://throughlightandtime.com/dark-tower-cdk-700-ii-lrgb-ha-rev-1-30-july-2024/). A [cometary globule](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240716.html), the swept-back cloud is shaped by intense ultraviolet radiation from the [OB association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_association#Types) of very [hot stars in NGC 6231](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2018/ngc6231/index.html), off the upper right corner of the scene. That energetic ultraviolet light also powers the globule's bordering reddish glow of [hydrogen gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap051223.html). Hot stars embedded in the dust can be seen as bluish [reflection nebulae](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011228.html). This dark tower and associated nebulae are about 5,000 light-years away.
