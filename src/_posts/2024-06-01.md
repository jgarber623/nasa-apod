Get out your red/blue glasses and float next to Helene, small, icy moon of Saturn. [Appropriately named, Helene](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/saturn-moons/helene/in-depth/) is a Trojan moon, so called because it orbits at a [Lagrange point](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/what-is-a-lagrange-point/). A Lagrange point is a gravitationally stable position near two massive bodies, in this case [Saturn and larger moon Dione](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/saturn-moons/overview/). In fact, irregularly shaped ( about 36 by 32 by 30 kilometers) Helene orbits at Dione's leading Lagrange point while brotherly ice moon Polydeuces follows at Dione's trailing Lagrange point. [The sharp stereo anaglyph](http://space-3d-images.blogspot.com/2011/06/helene-3d-cassini-cattura-la-regina-del.html) was constructed from two Cassini images captured during [a close flyby](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/) in 2011. It shows part of the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Helene mottled with craters and gully-like features.
