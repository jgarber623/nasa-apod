How did a star form this beautiful nebula? In the middle of [emission nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_nebula) NGC 6164 is an [unusually massive star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-type_star). The central star has been compared to an [oyster's pearl](https://www.thepearlsource.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Black-pearls.jpg) and an [egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Egg) [protected](https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dog-protecting-cat-internet-meme-fb2__700.jpg) by the mythical sky [dragons of Ara](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220607.html). The star, visible in the center of the [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/7dexm4/) and catalogued as [HD 148937](https://telescope.live/gallery/hd-148937-ngc-6165), is so hot that the [ultraviolet light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/) it emits heats up gas that surrounds it. That gas was likely thrown off from the star previously, possibly the result of a [gravitational interaction](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/tides/) with a looping stellar companion. Expelled material might have been channeled by the [magnetic field](https://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Imagnet.html) of the massive star, in all creating the symmetric [shape of the bipolar nebula](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...961...72L/abstract). NGC 6164 spans about four [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) and is located about 3,600 light years away toward the southern constellation [Norma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_(constellation)).
