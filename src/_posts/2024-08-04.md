What would it look like to return home from outside our galaxy? Although designed to answer [greater questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGri4YNggoc), data from ESA's robotic [Gaia mission](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Gaia_overview) is helping to provide a uniquely [modern perspective](http://www.nature.com/news/milky-way-mapper-6-ways-the-gaia-spacecraft-will-change-astronomy-1.20569) on humanity's place in the universe. Gaia [orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_orbit) the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun) near the [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html) and resolves [stars' positions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT0Xh1BizSI) so precisely that it can determine a [slight shift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z_O66Z4l6Y) from its changing vantage point over the course of a year, a shift that is proportionately smaller for more [distant stars](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/solar_neighborhood.html) -- and so [determines distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder). In the first sequence of [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XORui0wFKnE), an illustration of the [Milky Way](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/milky-way-our-location/) is shown that soon [resolves](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111018.html) into a three-dimensional [visualization of Gaia star data](https://zah.uni-heidelberg.de/gaia/outreach/gaiasky/). A few notable stars are labelled with their [common names](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/starname.html), while others stars are labelled with numbers from a [Gaia catalog](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr1). Eventually, the [viewer arrives](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190818.html) in our stellar neighborhood where many stars were tracked by Gaia, and soon at our home star Sol, [the Sun](https://youtu.be/KQetemT1sWc). At the video's end, the reflective glow of Sol's third planet becomes visible: [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100713.html).
