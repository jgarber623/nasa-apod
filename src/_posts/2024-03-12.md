What's that over the horizon? What may look like a strangely [nearby galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231113.html) is actually a normal rocket's exhaust plume -- but unusually backlit. Although the [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) [Falcon 9](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/) rocket was [launched](https://youtu.be/kEupBbJI07g?t=3662) from [Cape Canaveral](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181001.html) in [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), its burned propellant was visible over a much wider area, with the featured photograph being taken from [Akureyri](https://youtu.be/TrQCPC-wdTc), [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland). The huge spaceship was lifted off a week ago, and the [resulting spectacle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171224.html) was captured soon afterward with a single 10-second [smartphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone) exposure, before it quickly dissipated. Like [noctilucent clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220712.html), the plume's brightness is caused by the [Twilight Effect](https://youtu.be/Y1Hfiirwgys), where an object is high enough to be illuminated by the twilight Sun, even when the observer on the ground experiences the darkness of night. The [spiral shape](https://www.businessinsider.com/mysterious-glowing-spirals-night-sky-could-be-spacex-rocket-fuel-2023-4) is likely caused by [high winds](https://youtu.be/rKUipxR3bDc) pushing the expelled gas into the shape of a [corkscrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corkscrew#/media/File:Korkenzieher_01_KMJ.jpg), which, when seen along the trajectory, looks like a [spiral](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240101.html). Stars and faint green and red [aurora](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/en/) appear in the background of this [extraordinary](https://www.floppycats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Heroic-Cat.webp) image.
