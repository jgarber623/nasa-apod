What's happening to Comet G3 ATLAS? After [passing near the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250120.html) in mid-January, the head of the comet has become dimmer and dimmer. By late January, Comet [C/2024 G3 (ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_G3_\(ATLAS\)) had become a [headless wonder](https://www.newsweek.com/comet-atlas-disintegrating-brightest-solar-system-sun-2017615) -- even though it continued to show [impressive](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250124.html) [tails](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250126.html) after sunset in the skies of [Earth](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/)'s [Southern Hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere). Pictured are images of Comet G3 ATLAS on successive January nights taken from [RÃ­o Hurtado](https://youtu.be/a5jUyVPIDAk), [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile). Clearly, the comet's head is brighter and more [centrally condensed](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fjvtxke42851c1.jpg) on the earlier days (left) than on later days (right). A key reason is likely that the [comet's nucleus of ice and rock](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/), at the [head](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/en/anatomy-of-a-comet.en.jpg)'s center, has [fragmented](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230903.html). Comet G3 ATLAS passed [well inside](https://theskylive.com/c2024g3-info) the orbit of [planet Mercury](https://science.nasa.gov/mercury/) when at its solar closest, a distance that where heat [destroys](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010521.html) [many](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000808.html) [comets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000913.html). Some of comet G3 ATLAS' [scattering remains](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230903.html) will continue to [orbit the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240811.html).
