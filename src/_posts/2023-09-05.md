The last full moon was doubly unusual. First of all, it was a [blue moon](https://moon.nasa.gov/news/197/super-blue-moons-your-questions-answered/). A modern definition of a [blue moon](https://www.loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/astronomy/item/what-is-a-blue-moon-is-it-ever-really-blue/) is a second full moon to occur during one [calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) month. Since there are 13 full moons in 2023, one month has to have two -- and that month was August. The first full moon was on August 1 and named a [Sturgeon Moon](https://www.fullmoonology.com/full-moon-calendar-2023/). The second reason that the last full moon was [unusual](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220704.html) was because it was a [supermoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon). A modern definition of [supermoon](https://moon.nasa.gov/news/197/super-blue-moons-your-questions-answered/) is a moon that reaches its full [phase](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/676/phases-of-the-moon/) when it is relatively close to Earth -- and so [appears](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5048) a bit larger and brighter than average. Pictured, the [blue supermoon of 2023](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230830.html) was imaged [hovering](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/002/232/bullet_cat.jpg) far behind a historic [castle](https://youtu.be/l11c8SqqTOM) and [lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castello_Maniace) in [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Syracuse), [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy).
