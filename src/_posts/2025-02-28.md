Planet Earth hangs in the background of this space age selfie. The snapshot was captured by the [IM-2 Nova-C lander Athena](https://www.intuitivemachines.com/im-2), just after stage separation following its February 26 [launch to the Moon](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/liftoff-nasa-tech-science-en-route-to-moon-with-intuitive-machines/). A tall robotic lander, Athena is scheduled to touch down on Thursday, March 6, in [Mons Mouton, a plateau](https://www.lroc.asu.edu/images/1401) near the Moonâ€™s South Pole. The intended landing site is in the central portion of one of the [Artemis 3](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-provides-update-on-artemis-iii-moon-landing-regions/) potential landing regions. Athena carries rovers and experiments as part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, including a drill intended to explore beneath the lunar surface in a search for evidence of frozen water. It also carries a propulsive drone dubbed the [Micro Nova Hopper](https://www.intuitivemachines.com/micro-nova). After release to the lunar surface, the autonomous drone is intended to hop into a nearby crater and send science data back to the lander.
