How did we get here? [Click play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSivvdIyeG4), sit back, and watch. A [computer simulation](https://www.illustris-project.org/media/) of the evolution of the universe provides insight into how [galaxies formed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation) and perspectives into [humanity's place in the universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010101.html). The [Illustris project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjSFR40SY58) [exhausted](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/0c/ba/94/0cba94c29324b1108fd7b5831742961c.jpg) 20 million CPU hours in 2014 following 12 billion resolution elements spanning a cube 35 million [light years](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) on a side as it evolved over 13 billion years. [The simulation](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014Natur.509..177V/abstract) tracks matter into the [formation](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120717.html) of a wide variety of [galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-are-galaxies/) types. As the virtual universe evolves, some of the matter expanding with the [universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210802.html) soon gravitationally condenses to form filaments, [galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130808.html), and [clusters of galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100502.html). The [featured video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A23Ro3kiB1E) takes the perspective of a virtual camera circling part of this changing universe, first showing the evolution of [dark matter](https://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/dark_matter/), then [hydrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml) gas coded by temperature ([0:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSivvdIyeG4&t=0m45s)), then heavy elements such as [helium](https://periodic.lanl.gov/2.shtml) and [carbon](https://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml) ([1:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSivvdIyeG4&t=1m30s)), and then back to [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) ([2:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSivvdIyeG4&t=2m07s)). On the lower left the time since the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) is listed, while on the lower right the type of matter being shown is listed. Explosions (0:50) depict galaxy-center supermassive black holes expelling bubbles of hot gas. Interesting discrepancies between [Illustris](http://www.illustris-project.org/) and the [real universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120813.html) have been studied, including why [the simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1418) produced an overabundance of old stars.
