The [North America nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America_Nebula) on the sky can do what the [North America continent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) on Earth cannot -- form stars. Specifically, in analogy to the Earth-confined continent, the bright part that appears as the [east coast](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160224.html) is actually a hot bed of gas, dust, and newly formed stars known as the [Cygnus Wall](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161011.html). The [featured image](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=8815926978442390&set=a.152943591407482) shows the star forming wall [lit and eroded](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241022.html) by [bright young stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211124.html) and [partly hidden](http://blogs.nvidia.co.kr/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2017/12/%EB%8B%99%EC%8A%A44.jpg) by the dark [dust](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain) they have created. The part of the [North America nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090630.html) (NGC 7000) shown spans about 50 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) and lies about 1,500 light years away toward the [constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation) of the Swan ([Cygnus](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cyg/index.html)).
