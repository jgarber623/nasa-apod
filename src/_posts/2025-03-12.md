Why does this galaxy look like a [curly vegetable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiddlehead)? The [Fiddlehead spiral galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/hubble-spots-a-curious-spiral/) likely gets its distorted spiral appearance from a [gravitational interaction](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201203.html) with its close-by elliptical companion [NGC 770](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_770#/media/File:NGC_0770_SDSS.jpg), seen just below. Cataloged as NGC 772 and Arp 78, the Fiddlehead spans over 200,000 light years, is a nearby 100 million light years beyond the stars of our Milky Way galaxy, and is visible toward the [constellation of the Ram](https://www.britannica.com/place/Aries) (Aries). But in the [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/gcz15v/0/), the Fiddlehead appears to have another companion -- one with a long and fuzzy tail: [Comet 43P/Wolf-Harrington](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=43P%2FWolf-Harrington). Though the comet appears to be aimed straight at the massive galaxy, it is actually much closer to us, residing only [light minutes](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) away -- well within our Solar System. The comet will never reach the distant spiral galaxy, nor is it [physically related](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/cztlvz/precious_gang_of_two_real_cats_and_a_fake_one/#lightbox) to it. By a fortunate trick of perspective, though, these two cosmic wonders briefly share the same frame taken late last year from [Calern](https://youtu.be/bnQzW7TEtPQ), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France).
