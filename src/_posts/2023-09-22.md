[During the day](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-03/01/c_139775005.htm), over 12,000 large mirrors reflect sunlight at the 100-megawatt, molten-salt, solar thermal power plant at the western edge of the Gobi desert near [Dunhuang](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090619.html), Gansu Province, China. Individual mirror panels turn to track the sun like sunflowers. They conspire to act as a single super mirror reflecting the sunlight toward a fixed position, the power station's central tower. [During the night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Pbr2wIgCHE) the mirrors stand motionless though. They reflect the light of the countless distant stars, clusters and nebulae of the Milky Way [and beyond](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/index.html). This [sci-fi](https://www.fictionunbound.com/blog/2016/4/30/three-body-problem) night skyscape was created with a camera fixed to a tripod near the edge of the giant mirror matrix on September 15. The camera's combined sequence of digital exposures captures concentric arcs of celestial [star trails](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220728.html) through the night with star trails in [surreal mirrored reflection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Pbr2wIgCHE).
