This [well-composed composite panoramic view](https://www.instagram.com/kchayphotos/p/C680EGcva1P/) looks due south from Banks Peninsula near Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island. The base of a tower-like rocky sea stack is awash in the foreground, with stars of the Southern Cross at the top of the frame and planet Earth's south celestial pole near center. Still, captured on May 11, vibrant aurora australis dominate the starry southern sea and skyscape. The shimmering southern lights were part of [extensive auroral displays](https://www.facebook.com/media/set?set=a.431368006258449&type=3) that entertained skywatchers in northern and southern hemispheres around planet Earth, caused by intense geomagnetic storms. The extreme [spaceweather](https://spaceweather.com/) was triggered by the impact of [coronal mass ejections](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/what-coronal-mass-ejection-or-cme/) launched from powerful [solar active region](https://blogs.nasa.gov/solarcycle25/) AR 3664.
