[Dark markings](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090425.html) and bright nebulae in this telescopic southern sky view are telltale signs of young stars and [active](https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/image/sig06-002a-spitzer-infrared-view-of-herbig-haro-49-50-a-cosmic-tornado) [star formation](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve). They lie a mere 650 light-years away, [at the boundary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05124) of the [local bubble](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/1000-light-year-bubble-is-the-source-of-all-nearby-baby-stars/?utm_source=cc&utm_medium=newsletter) and the Chamaeleon molecular cloud complex. Regions with young stars identified as dusty reflection nebulae from the 1946 [Cederblad catalog](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1946MeLuS.119....1C/abstract) include the C-shaped Ced 110 just above and right of center, and bluish Ced 111 below it. Also a standout in the frame, the orange tinted V-shape of the [Chamaeleon Infrared Nebula](https://noirlab.edu/public/news/noirlab2129/) (Cha IRN) was carved by material streaming from a newly formed low-mass star. [The well-composed image](https://www.astrobin.com/32d8tb/) spans 1.5 degrees. That's about 17 light-years at the estimated distance of the nearby [Chamaeleon I molecular cloud](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2020/06/Chamaeleon_I_molecular_cloud_viewed_by_Herschel_and_Planck).
