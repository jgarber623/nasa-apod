What if you could see out to the edge of the [observable universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220316.html)? You would see galaxies, galaxies, galaxies, and then, well, [quasar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220222.html)s, which are the bright centers of distant [galaxies](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-are-galaxies). To expand understanding of the very largest scales that humanity can see, [a map](https://youtu.be/Oekma9SZMMI) of the galaxies and quasars found by the [Sloan Digital Sky](https://www.sdss.org/instruments/) [Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey) from 2000 to 2020 -- out to near the [edge](https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/08/78/88/360_F_208788856_Gp1H7eajSqVxoZYqX7xqWf24iC4UCruI.jpg) of the [observable universe](https://esahubble.org/videos/hubblecast79c/) -- has been composed. [Featured here](https://mapoftheuniverse.net/), one wedge from this survey encompasses about 200,000 [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy) and [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar) out beyond a [look-back time](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_lookback.html) of 12 billion years and [cosmological redshift](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130408.html) 5. Almost every dot in the nearby lower part of [the illustration](https://hub.jhu.edu/2022/11/17/interactive-universe-map/) represents a [galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220529.html), with redness indicating increasing [redshift](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2019/20/4378-Image) and distance. Similarly, almost every dot on the upper part represents a distant [quasar](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/q/quasar), with blue-shaded dots being closer than red. Clearly shown among [many discoveries](https://www.sdss.org/science/), gravity between galaxies has caused the nearby universe to [condense](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200223.html) and become increasingly [more filamentary](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990905.html) than the [distant universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210802.html).
