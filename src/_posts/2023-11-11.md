This broad, [luminous red arc](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL098511) was a surprising visitor to partly cloudy evening skies over northern France. Captured extending toward the zenith in a [west-to-east mosaic](https://www.flickr.com/photos/julienlooten/53311294522/) of images from November 5, the faint atmospheric ribbon of light is an example of a Stable Auroral Red (SAR) arc. The rare [night sky phenomenon](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL101205) was also spotted at unusually low latitudes around world, along with more dynamic auroral displays during an [intense geomagnetic storm](https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&day=07&month=11&year=2023). SAR arcs and their relation to auroral emission have been [explored by citizen science](https://eos.org/research-spotlights/from-sar-arc-to-steve-an-atmospheric-evolution) and [satellite](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/swarm) investigations. From altitudes substantially above the normal auroral glow, the deep red SAR emission is thought to be caused by strong heating due to currents flowing in planet Earth's inner [magnetosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/planetary-science/earths-magnetosphere/). Beyond this SAR, the Milky Way arcs above the cloud banks [along the horizon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230927.html), a regular visitor to night skies over northern France.
