These clouds are [doubly](https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2540564/792x594/scale;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg) unusual. First, they are rare [noctilucent clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctilucent_cloud), meaning that they are [visible at night](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220712.html) -- but only just before sunrise or just after sunset. Second, the source of these [noctilucent clouds](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/nasa-noctilucent-clouds/) is actually known. In this rare case, the source of the [sunlight-reflecting ice-crystals](https://www.weather.gov/arx/why_halos_sundogs_pillars) in the [upper atmosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/mesosphere/en/) can be traced back to the [launch of a nearby SpaceX rocke](https://youtu.be/z3yDEVxI5TM)t about 30 minutes earlier. Known more formally as [polar mesospheric clouds](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/80217/polar-mesospheric-clouds-south-pacific-ocean), the vertex of these icy wisps happens to converge just in front of a [rising](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211010.html) crescent Moon. The featured image -- and [accompanying video](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2407/NoctilucentFlorida_Pouquet.mp4) -- were captured over [Orlando](https://youtu.be/an8cAHG-pqs), [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida), [USA](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/) about a week ago. The bright spot to the right of the Moon is the planet [Jupiter](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/), while the dotted [lights](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240609.html) above the horizon on the right are from an [airplane](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/VirtualAero/BottleRocket/airplane/airplane.html).
