[For some](https://www.instagram.com/neuveritelne.brno/), these subtle bands of light and shadow stretched across the sky as the Sun set on July 11. Known as [anticrepuscular](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200318.html) rays, the bands are formed as a large cloud bank near the western horizon cast [long shadows](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220924.html) through the atmosphere at sunset. Due to the camera's perspective, the bands of light and shadow seem to converge toward the eastern (opposite) horizon at a point seen just above a 14th century [hilltop castle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160916.html) near Brno, Czech Republic. In the foreground, [denizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sunday_Afternoon_on_the_Island_of_La_Grande_Jatte#/media/File:A_Sunday_on_La_Grande_Jatte,_Georges_Seurat,_1884.jpg) of planet Earth are enjoying the region's annual [Planet Festival](https://www.festivalplanetbrno.cz/) in the park below the Brno Observatory and Planetarium. And while crepuscular and anticrepuscular rays are a relatively common atmospheric phenomenon, this festival's 10 meter diameter inflatable spheres representing [bodies of the Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/planets/) are less often seen [on planet Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2407/2024-07-11Pavel_models1024p.jpg).
