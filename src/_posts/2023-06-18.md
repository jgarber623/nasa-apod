Why would clouds form a hexagon on Saturn? Nobody is sure. Originally discovered during the [Voyager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1) flybys of Saturn in the 1980s, nobody has ever seen anything like it anywhere else in the [Solar System](https://space.jpl.nasa.gov/). Acquiring its first sunlit views of far northern [Saturn in late 2012](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121204.html), the Cassini spacecraft's wide-angle camera recorded this [stunning, false-color image](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14946) of the ringed planet's north pole. The composite of near-infrared image data results in red hues for low clouds and green for high ones, giving the [Saturnian](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/) cloudscape a vivid appearance. This and similar images show the stability of the [hexagon](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hexagon.html) even 20+ years after Voyager. [Movies](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09187) of Saturn's North Pole show the cloud structure maintaining its [hexagonal structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_hexagon) while rotating. Unlike individual clouds appearing like a [hexagon on Earth](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/59758/hexagonal-cloud-cells-in-south-atlantic-ocean), the Saturn [cloud pattern](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20070327.html) appears to have [six well defined sides](https://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2010/2471.html) of nearly equal length. Four [Earth](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0610/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg)s could fit inside the [hexagon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon). Beyond the cloud tops at the upper right, arcs of the planet's [eye-catching](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1872746/cat-looking-shocked.jpg) [rings](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131021.html) are tinted bright blue.
