Globular star cluster 47 Tucanae is a jewel of the southern sky. Also [known as NGC 104](http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n0104.html), it roams the halo of our Milky Way Galaxy along with some 200 other [globular star clusters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster). The second brightest globular cluster (after [Omega Centauri](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230316.html)) as seen from planet Earth, 47 Tuc lies about 13,000 light-years away. It can be spotted with the naked-eye close on the sky to the [Small Magellanic Cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100903.html) in the constellation of [the Toucan](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/tuc/). The dense cluster is made up of hundreds of thousands [of stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080906.html) in a volume only about 120 light-years across. [Red giant stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap081218.html) on the outskirts of the cluster are easy to pick out as yellowish stars in this [sharp telescopic portrait](https://www.glitteringlights.com/Images/Deep-Sky/Open-and-Globular-clusters/i-SPsngr7/A). Tightly packed globular cluster 47 Tuc is also home to a star with the closest known [orbit around a black hole](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/star-discovered-in-closest-known-orbit-around-likely-black-hole.html).
