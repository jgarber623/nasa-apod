This rock structure is not only surreal -- it's real. Perhaps the reason it's not more famous is that it is smaller than one might guess: the capstone rock overhangs only a [few meters](https://liveloveruntravel.com/king-of-wings-new-mexico/). Even so, the [King of Wings](https://www.summitpost.org/king-of-wings/1010769) outcrop, located in [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico), [USA](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/), is a fascinating example of an unusual type of rock structure called a [hoodoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_\(geology\)). [Hoodoo](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200813.html)s may [form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_\(geology\)#Formation) when a layer of hard rock overlays a layer of [eroding](http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/erosion/) softer rock. Figuring out the details of incorporating [this hoodoo](https://youtu.be/OcWAkbG_YLo) into a night-sky photoshoot took over a year. Besides [waiting for a suitably picturesque night](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/funny-cat-tired-boring-lying-260nw-1447517609.jpg) behind a sky with few clouds, the foreground had to be [artificially lit](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230308.html) just right relative to the [natural glow](https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/news-display.cfm?News_ID=745) of the background. After much planning and waiting, the final shot, [featured here](http://waynepinkstonphoto.com/WhatsNew/i-Trxjrp7/A), was taken in May 2016. Mimicking the horizontal bar, the background sky features the band of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) stretching overhead.
