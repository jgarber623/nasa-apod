[You can take](https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/blueshift/index.php/2010/08/20/maggies-blog-beijings-ancient-observatory/) a subway ride to visit this observatory in Beijing, China but you won't find any telescopes there. Starting in the 1400s astronomers erected devices at the [Beijing Ancient Observatory](https://www.bjp.org.cn/en/Beijing%20Ancient%20Observatory/History%20of%20the%20Observatory/index.shtml) site to enable them to accurately measure and track the positions of [naked-eye stars and planets](https://science.nasa.gov/skywatching/). Some of the large, ornate [astronomical instruments](https://www.bjp.org.cn/en/Beijing%20Ancient%20Observatory/Astronomical%20instruments/list.shtml) are still standing. You can even see stars from the star observation platform today, but now only the very brightest celestial beacons are visible [against the city lights](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110716.html). In this time series of exposures from a camera fixed to a tripod to record graceful arcing startrails, the brightest trail is actually the Moon. Its broad arc is seen behind the ancient observatory's brass [armillary sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillary_sphere). Compare this picture from the Beijing Ancient Observatory taken in September 2023 to [one taken in 1895](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap980506.html).
