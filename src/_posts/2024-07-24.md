Our Moon doesn't really have craters this big. [Earth's Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/), Luna, also doesn't naturally show this spikey texture, and its colors are more subtle. But this digital creation is based on reality. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/C9VolwSsvhk/) is a digital composite of a good Moon image and surface height data taken from NASA's [Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lro/lola/) (LOLA) mission -- and then exaggerated for [educational understanding](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/fc529a49-3f59-4502-a7c3-5ac4c3c5a032/d5q4hbz-5b803f71-04b3-47a3-a27c-8f49425d3d8c.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2ZjNTI5YTQ5LTNmNTktNDUwMi1hN2MzLTVhYzRjM2M1YTAzMlwvZDVxNGhiei01YjgwM2Y3MS0wNGIzLTQ3YTMtYTI3Yy04ZjQ5NDI1ZDNkOGMuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.zOT8uNXcb5eNG6mmR7iiEuPGjUE8u35YDhheTEmE8lM). The digital enhancements, for example, accentuate [lunar highlands](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/exploration/education/hsResearch/presentations/2017-2018/Henry-M-Jackson-Moon-a.pdf) and show more clearly craters that illustrate the [tremendous bombardment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment) our Moon has been through during its [4.6-billion-year history](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/composition/#otp_lunar_origins). The [dark areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare#/media/File:Moon_names.svg), called [maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare), have fewer [craters](https://youtu.be/HTukFx17Ryg) and were once seas of [molten lava](https://youtu.be/wiRdr5LzbwY). Additionally, the image [colors](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210831.html), although based on the moon's real composition, are changed and exaggerated. Here, a blue hue indicates a region that is [iron rich](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/a-story-of-iron-in-ancient-sediments/), while orange indicates a slight excess of [aluminum](https://youtu.be/ZVkpQKRgHvU). Although the [Moon](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-the-moon/en/) has shown the same side to the Earth for billions of years, [modern technology](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140113.html) is allowing humanity to learn [much more](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190717.html) about it -- and how it [affects the Earth](https://www.iop.org/explore-physics/moon/how-does-moon-affect-earth).
