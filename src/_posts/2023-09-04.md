As stars die, they create clouds. Two stellar death clouds of gas and dust can be found toward the high-flying constellation of the Swan (Cygnus) as they [drift through](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150819.html) rich star fields in the plane of our [Milky Way Galaxy](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html). Caught here within the [telescopic field of view](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvNSVbhsXYs/) are the [Soap Bubble](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150113.html) (lower left) and the [Crescent Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210617.html) (upper right). Both were formed at the final phase in the life of a star. Also known as NGC 6888, the Crescent Nebula was shaped as its bright, central massive [Wolf-Rayet star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet_star), WR 136, shed its outer envelope in a strong stellar wind. Burning through fuel at a prodigious rate, WR 136 is near the end of [a short life](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/hubble-view-wolf-rayet-stars-intense-and-short-lived) that should finish in a spectacular [supernova](https://youtu.be/wymMn-SmALY) explosion. [Discovered in 2013](http://www.starimager.com/Image%20Gallery%20Pages/Hydrogen%20Alpha%20Images/ic%201318_AP_8%20pane%20mosaic_bubble%20nebula.htm), the Soap Bubble Nebula is likely a [planetary nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula), the final shroud of a lower mass, long-lived, Sun-like star destined to become a slowly cooling white dwarf. Both stellar nebulas are about 5,000 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) distant, with the larger Crescent Nebula [spanning](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1170788685/photo/jumping-cat.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=_Ot_m-qULa-AS2ueDMH8Qc4vu8jdsNso2hzIxsVGjTw=) about 25 light-years across. Within a few million years, both will likely have dispersed.
