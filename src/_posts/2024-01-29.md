The well-known Pleiades star cluster is slowly destroying part of a passing cloud of gas and dust. The [Pleiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades) is the brightest [open cluster of stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/open_clusters.html) on Earth's sky and [can be seen](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130212.html) from almost any northerly location with the [unaided eye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFVbLnXWn6A). Over the past 100,000 years, a field of gas and dust is moving by chance right through the [Pleiades](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131122.html) star cluster and is causing a strong reaction between the [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve) and dust. The passing cloud might be part of the [Radcliffe wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_wave), a [newly discovered](https://youtu.be/VJLl0gaMlGE) structure of gas and dust connecting several regions of star formation in the [nearby part](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/5000lys.html) of our [Milky Way galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/). Pressure from the stars' light significantly repels [the dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140225.html) in the surrounding blue [reflection nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/reflection_nebulae.html), with smaller [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html) particles being repelled more strongly. A short-term result is that parts of the dust cloud have become [filamentary](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120215.html) and [stratified](https://media.tenor.com/wkbFi2XVi08AAAAC/cat-stack-cat-tower.gif). The featured deep image incorporates nearly 9 hours of exposure and was captured from [Utah Desert Remote Observatory](https://utahdesertremote.com/udro-apod-images/) in [Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), last year.
