Are asteroids dangerous? Some are, but the likelihood of a dangerous asteroid striking the Earth during any given year is low. Because some past mass [extinction event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event)s have been linked to asteroid impacts, however, humanity has made it a priority to find and catalog those [asteroids](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroid-watch) that may one day affect [life on Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230521.html). [Pictured here](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17041) are the orbits of the over 1,000 known [Potentially Hazardous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentially_hazardous_object) Asteroids (PHAs). These documented tumbling [boulders](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Balanced_Rock.jpg) of rock and ice are over 140 meters across and will pass within 7.5 million kilometers of Earth -- about 20 times the distance to the Moon. Although none of them will [strike the Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_COcHHvte-0) in the next 100 years -- [not all PHAs have been discovered](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/multimedia/gallery/neowise/pia14734.html), and past 100 years, many orbits become hard to predict. Were an [asteroid](https://www.vaticanobservatory.org/sacred-space-astronomy/astronomy-picture-of-the-day-apod-authors-get-asteroid-named-after-them/) of this size to [impact the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event), it could raise [dangerous tsunami](https://youtu.be/6scCF_8YN70)s, for example. To investigate Earth-saving strategies, NASA successfully tested the [Double Asteroid Redirection Test](https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/dart) ([DART](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220927.html)) mission last year. Of course, rocks and ice bits of much smaller size [strike the Earth every day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210131.html), usually pose no danger, and sometimes create [memorable fireball](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110123.html) and [meteor displays](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121119.html).
