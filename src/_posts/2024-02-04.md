Stars are forming in the gigantic dust pillar called the Cone Nebula. Cones, [pillars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011125.html), and majestic [flowing shapes](http://www.goodearthgraphics.com/virtcave/staltite/staltite.html) abound in [stellar nurseries](https://esahubble.org/science/formation_of_stars/) where natal clouds of gas and dust are buffeted by energetic winds from newborn stars. The [Cone Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230110.html), a well-known example, lies within the bright galactic star-forming region [NGC 2264](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201226.html). The [Cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_nebula) was captured in unprecedented detail in [this close-up composite](https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/13313909663/) of several observations from the Earth-orbiting [Hubble Space Telescope](https://esahubble.org/about/). While the [Cone Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190416.html), about 2,500 [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/)s away in [Monoceros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoceros), is around 7 light-years long, [the region](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0205/cone_hst_label.jpg) pictured here surrounding the cone's blunted head is a mere 2.5 light-years across. In [our neck of the galaxy](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html) that distance is just over half way from our Sun to its [nearest stellar neighbors](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160825.html) in the [Alpha Centauri](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120628.html) star system. The massive star [NGC 2264 IRS](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970611.html), seen by Hubble's infrared camera in 1997, is the likely source of the [wind sculpting](https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/05/92/36/97/360_F_592369798_B4z51rOFjAw2rzf0CuZmcv8Pic6OpiB9.jpg) the Cone Nebula and lies off the top of the image. The [Cone Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070509.html)'s reddish veil is produced by dust and glowing hydrogen gas.
