Why are there so many cyclones around the north pole of Jupiter? [The topic](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/347/nasa-juno-findings-jupiters-jet-streams-are-unearthly/) is still being researched. NASA's robotic [Juno mission](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno/) orbiting Jupiter took data in 2018 that was used to construct [this stunning view](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22335) of the curious cyclones at Jupiter's north pole. Measuring the [thermal emission](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/lj1x1o/thermal_cat/#lightbox) from Jovian cloud tops, the [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) observations are not restricted to the [hemisphere illuminated](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160914.html) by sunlight. [They reveal](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25491) eight cyclonic features that surround a cyclone about 4,000 kilometers in diameter, just offset from the giant planet's geographic north pole. Similar data show a cyclone at the [Jovian south pole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161025.html) with five circumpolar cyclones. The south pole cyclones are slightly larger than their northern cousins. [Oddly](https://i.imgur.com/mYiRh.png), data from the once Saturn-orbiting [Cassini mission](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/about-the-mission/) has shown that Saturn's [north](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250223.html) and [south pole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap081027.html)s each have only a single cyclonic [storm system](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130502.html).
