Globular star cluster [Omega Centauri](https://earthsky.org/clusters-nebulae-galaxies/omega-centauri-milky-ways-prize-star-cluster) [packs](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080906.html) about 10 million stars much older than the Sun into a volume some 150 light-years in diameter. Also known as NGC 5139, at a distance of 15,000 light-years it's the largest and brightest of 200 or so known [globular clusters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_clusters) that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy. Though most star clusters consist of stars with the same age and composition, the enigmatic Omega Cen exhibits the presence of [different](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...653L...8L/abstract) stellar populations with a spread of ages and chemical abundances. In fact, [Omega Cen may be](https://esahubble.org/news/heic0809/) the [remnant](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019NatAs...3..667I/abstract) core of a small galaxy merging with the Milky Way. With a [yellowish hue](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151224.html), Omega Centauri's red giant stars are easy to pick out in this [sharp telescopic view](https://www.ccdastrophoto.com/galleries/globular-cluster/ngc5139/). A two-decade-long exploration of the dense star cluster with the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed evidence for a massive black hole near the [center of Omega Centauri](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/nasas-hubble-finds-strong-evidence-for-intermediate-mass-black-hole-in-omega-centauri/).
