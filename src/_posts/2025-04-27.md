What is creating the strange texture of IC 418? Dubbed the [Spirograph Nebula](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/hubbles-spirograph/) for its resemblance to drawings from a [cyclical drawing tool](http://www.wordsmith.org/~anu/java/spirograph.html), [planetary nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula) IC 418 shows [patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) that are not well understood. Perhaps they are related to chaotic [winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind) from the variable central star, which [changes brightness unpredictably](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997A%26A...320..125H/abstract) in just a few hours. By contrast, evidence indicates that only a few million years ago, [IC 418](http://observing.skyhound.com/archives/jan/IC_418.html) was probably a well-understood star similar to our [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/). Only a few thousand years ago, [IC 418](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_418) was probably a common [red giant](http://www.historyoftheuniverse.com/starold.html) star. Since running out of [nuclear fuel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E-0j90Cwpk), though, the outer envelope has begun expanding outward leaving a [hot remnant core](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100221.html) destined to become a [white-dwarf star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000910.html), visible in the image center. The light from the central core excites surrounding [atoms](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/tryit/atom/) in the [nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/planetary_nebulae.html) causing them to glow. [IC 418](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...507.1517M/abstract) lies about 2000 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) away and spans 0.3 light-years across. [This false-color image](https://science.nasa.gov/asset/hubble/the-spirograph-nebula-ic-418/) taken from the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.stsci.edu/hst) reveals the [unusual details](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/8smej7/surprised_cat/#lightbox).
