Comet ATLAS is really bright now, but also really close to the Sun. Outside the glow of the Sun, [Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_G3_\(ATLAS\)) would be one of the more remarkable comet sights of recent years, reflecting about as much sunlight to Earth as [Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241019.html) did in October, and now [rivaling](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230306.html) even planet [Venus](https://science.nasa.gov/venus/). But the giant snowball is now [so close to the Sun](https://theskylive.com/3dsolarsystem?obj=c2024g3) that it can only be seen through the light of the early morning dawn or the early evening dusk. Today, [Comet ATLAS](https://earthsky.org/tonight/brightest-comet-of-2025-atlas-g3-southern-hemisphere/) is at [perihelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#Perihelion_and_aphelion) -- its closest ever to the Sun. Although the future brightness of comets is [notoriously hard](https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/18/45/30/360_F_218453068_WRjhtH9MzO33Cb19K8acZI2VZvXueQ70.jpg) to predict, there is hope that [Comet ATLAS](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2463620-comet-that-could-shine-as-bright-as-venus-set-to-be-visible-from-earth/) will survive its close pass near the Sun and [remain bright](https://theskylive.com/c2024g3-info) enough to be seen with the unaided eye over the next few days -- and possibly a good [camera comet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240131.html) for weeks. The [featured image](https://www.petrhoralek.com/?p=25209) was taken early yesterday morning near [TornaÄ¾a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torna%C4%BEa), [Slovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia).
