Only in the fleeting darkness of a total solar eclipse is the light of the solar corona easily visible. Normally overwhelmed by the bright solar disk, the [expansive corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230516.html), the [sun's outer atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona), is an alluring sight. But the subtle details and [extreme ranges](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080920.html) in the corona's brightness, although discernible to the eye, are notoriously difficult to photograph. [Pictured here](https://philhart.com/exmouth-eclipse), however, using multiple images and digital processing, is a detailed image of the Sun's corona taken during the [April 20, 2023 total](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2023-april-20) solar eclipse from [Exmouth](https://youtu.be/WB8ch2NtBNQ?t=42), Australia. Clearly visible are [intricate layers](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2249/2214149648_5a980d4c26_o.jpg) and glowing caustics of an ever changing mixture of hot gas and [magnetic fields](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/understanding-the-magnetic-sun). Bright [looping prominences](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090531.html) appear pink just around the Sun's [limb](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap020222.html). A similar solar corona might be [visible](https://eclipse.aas.org/resources/solar-filters) through clear skies in a [narrow swath across the North America](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/) during the total solar eclipse that occurs [just six days from today](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/faq/)
