Have you seen the bird in the Milky Way? Beyond the [man in the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html), the night sky is filled with stories, and cultures throughout history have projected some of their most [enduring legends](https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/download-view.cfm?Doc_ID=666) onto the stars and dust above. Generations of people see these celestial icons, hear their associated stories, and pass them down. [Pictured here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrhFtNvLWAS/) is not only a segment of the [central band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230319.html) of our [Milky Way galaxy](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html), but, according to [folklore of several native peoples](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/12/4/805) of [Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay), the outline of a great bird called [Ñandú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_(bird)). Furthermore, Ñandú's footprint is associated with the [Southern](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210125.html) [Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux) asterism. In the foreground, in [silhouette](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210112.html), is a statue of [María Micaela Guyunusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Micaela_Guyunusa), an indigenous woman of the [Charrúa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charr%C3%Baa) people who lived in the 1800s and endures as a symbol of colonial resistance. The composite image was taken in mid-April in [Cabo Polonio](https://youtu.be/6yCSLDx3OB4), Uruguay, with the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean) in the background.
