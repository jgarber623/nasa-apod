The sprite and tree could hardly be more different. To start, the red [sprite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(lightning)) is an unusual form of lightning, while the tree is a [common plant](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/12744/trees). The sprite is [far away](https://diaryofdennis.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/shy-cat-wants-me-to-keep-distance.jpg) -- high in [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/upper-atmosphere-phenomena-caused-by-thunderstorms/), while the tree is [nearby](https://www.petmoo.com/wp-content/uploads/toptengamaimages/how-to-select-the-right-pet-camera/latest-pet-camera-features.jpg) -- only about a football field away. The [sprite is fast](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210104.html) -- [electrons](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200010/history.cfm) streaming up and down at near [light's speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light), while the tree is slow -- wood anchored to the ground. The [sprite](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210330.html) is bright -- lighting up the sky, while the tree is dim -- shining mostly by reflected light. The [sprite](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/11059) was fleeting -- lasting only a small fraction of a second, while the [tree is durable](https://onetreeplanted.org/blogs/stories/oldest-tallest-biggest-trees) -- living now for many years. Both however, when captured together, appear oddly similar in this [featured composite image](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwzJQ8ANidq/) captured early this month in France as a thunderstorm passed over mountains of the [Atlantic Pyrenees](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/undefined).
