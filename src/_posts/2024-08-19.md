Inside the Cocoon Nebula is a newly developing cluster of stars. Cataloged as [IC 5146](http://www.universetoday.com/2008/07/07/the-cosmic-cocoon-ic-5146-by-tom-v-davis/), the beautiful nebula is nearly 15 [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/)s wide. Soaring high in [northern summer night skies](https://science.nasa.gov/skywatching/), it's located some 4,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Swan ([Cygnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_\(constellation\))). Like other star forming regions, it stands out in red, glowing, [hydrogen gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050930.html) excited by young, hot stars, and [dust-reflected](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061211.html) starlight at the edge of an otherwise invisible [molecular cloud](http://loke.as.arizona.edu/~ckulesa/research/overview.html). In fact, the bright star found near the center of this nebula is likely only a few hundred thousand years old, powering the nebular glow as it [clears out](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...571A..93G/abstract) a cavity in the [molecular cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html)'s star forming dust and gas. A 48-hour long integration resulted in this [exceptionally deep color view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astrotolva/53899561718/) tracing [tantalizing](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/832162420/photo/intrigued-cat-under-a-blanket.jpg?s=1024x1024&w=is&k=20&c=0GQ8NOKdnthUpRQxIhwt6ZZ-K-x6aRo8Y_lhNhijADQ=) features within and surrounding the dusty [stellar nursery](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/).
