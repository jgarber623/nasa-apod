New [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/) are [born](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4190-Image) from the [remnants](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/investigating-the-origins-of-the-crab-nebula-with-nasas-webb/) of [dead](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/the-lives-times-and-deaths-of-stars/) [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star)s. The gaseous remnant of the [gravitational collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_collapse) and subsequent death of a very [massive star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200830.html) in our [Milky Way](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) created the [G296.5+10.0](https://www.astrobin.com/kpl1kc/?q=Betta%20fish) [supernova remnant](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230115.html), of which the [featured](https://www.astrobin.com/84ogxw/) Mermaid Nebula is part. Also known as the [Betta Fish Nebula](https://www.astrobin.com/gcl2j7/C/), the Mermaid Nebula makes up part of an unusual [subclass of supernova remnants](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/objects/snrs/snrstext.html) that are [two-sided](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992A%26A...265..752S/abstract) and nearly circular. Originally [discovered](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979ApJ...230L..27T/abstract) in [X-rays](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays/), the filamentary nebula is a frequently studied source also in [radio](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves/) and [gamma-ray](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/12_gammarays/) light. The blue color visible here originates from [doubly ionized oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_ionized_oxygen) (OIII), while the deep red is emitted by [hydrogen gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-alpha). The nebula's [mermaid-like](https://www.mewcats.com/cdn/shop/files/MermaidCatCostumeFunnyPhotoPropClothes_1.jpg) shape has proven to be [useful](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.528.2095E/abstract) for measurements of the [interstellar magnetic field](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210120.html).
