For ten years the stargazer dreamed of taking a picture like this. The dreamer knew that the [White Desert National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Desert_National_Park) in [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt)'s [Western Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Desert_(Egypt)) is a picturesque place hosting numerous [chalk formations](https://www.inside-egypt.com/the-white-desert.html) sculpted into [surreal structures](https://youtu.be/vgBpr-7AUjg) by a sandy wind. The dreamer knew that the sky above could be [impressively dark](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200408.html) on a clear moonless night, showing highlights such as the [central band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191022.html) of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/) in impressive color and detail. So the dreamer invited an even more [experienced astrophotographer](https://www.instagram.com/vikaschanderastrophotography/) to spend three weeks together in the desert and [plan](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/62/75/3062756a297f1e3c22e35f3fe89b3ecc.jpg) the composite images that needed to be taken and processed to create the dream image. Over three days in mid-March, the base images were taken, all with the same camera and from the same location. The impressive result is featured here, with the dreamer -- proudly wearing a traditional [Bedouin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin) [galabyia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellabiya) -- pictured in the foreground.
