How does a comet tail change? It depends on the comet. The ion tail of [Comet 12P/Ponsâ€“Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12P/Pons%E2%80%93Brooks) has been changing markedly, as detailed in the featured image sequenced over nine days from March 6 to 14 (top to bottom). On some days, the comet's [ion tail](http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/tail.html) was relatively long and complex, but not every day. Reasons for tail changes include the rate of [ejection of material](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151118.html) from the [comet's nucleus](https://www.cometcampaign.org/files/images/comets_spacecraft.jpg), the strength and complexity of the [passing solar wind](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240219.html), and the [rotation rate](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240318.html) of the [comet](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/). Over the course of a week, apparent changes even include a change of perspective from the Earth. In general, a comet's [ion tail will point away from the Sun](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/en/anatomy-of-a-comet.en.jpg), as gas expelled is pushed out by the [Sun's wind](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000318.html). Today, [Pons-Brooks](https://earthsky.org/tonight/12-p-comet-pons-brooks-outburst-millennium-falcon-bright-2024-eclipse/) may become a rare comet [suddenly visible](https://live.staticflickr.com/5613/15634745431_af629b9374.jpg) in the middle of the day for those able to see the [Sun totally eclipsed by the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170820.html).
