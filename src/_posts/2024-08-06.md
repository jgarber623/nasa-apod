What makes this storm cloud so colorful? First, the [cloud](https://climatekids.nasa.gov/cloud-formation/) itself is composed of millions of tiny droplets of water and ice. Its bottom is almost completely flat -- but this isn't unusual. [Bottom flatness in clouds](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-01/flat-bottom-clouds-and-the-science-behind-them/12591230) is generally caused by [air temperature](https://scied.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/interactives/atmosphere-altitude/vertpro_comet.jpg) dropping as you go up, and that above a specific height, water-saturated air condenses out water droplets. The [shape of the cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040218.html) middle is caused by a water-droplet-laden column of air being blown upward. [Most unusual](https://www.seadna.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hilariously-Surprised-Dogs.jpg), though, are the orange and yellow colors. Both [colors are caused](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/clouds/color-of-clouds) by the cloud's water drops reflecting sunlight. The orange color in the cloud's middle and bottom sections are reflections of a nearly [red sunset](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170120.html). In contrast, the yellow color of the cloud's top results from [reflection of light from a not-yet-setting Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180613.html), where some -- but less -- [blue light is being scattered away](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/). Appearing to [float above](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230514.html) the plains in [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas), the [featured impressive image](https://www.instagram.com/p/CO_y-rKhqhK/) of a dynamic [cumulonimbus cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_cloud) was [captured in 2021](https://laurarowe.smugmug.com/About-Laura-Rowe) while investigating a [tornado](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200517.html).
