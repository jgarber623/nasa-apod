Named for the southern [constellation](https://earthsky.org/constellations/fornax-the-furnace-galaxy-hubble-ultra-deep-field/) toward which most of its galaxies can be found, the [Fornax Cluster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax_cluster) is one of the closest clusters of galaxies. About 62 million light-years away, it's over 20 times more distant than our neighboring [Andromeda Galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130927.html), but only about 10 percent farther along than the better known and more populated [Virgo Galaxy Cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110422.html). Seen across [this three degree wide](https://www.astrobin.com/z2lojf/) field-of-view, almost every yellowish splotch on the image is an elliptical galaxy in the Fornax cluster. Elliptical galaxies [NGC 1399 and NGC 1404](https://noirlab.edu/public/news/noirlab2126/) are the dominant, bright cluster members toward the bottom center. A standout, large barred spiral galaxy, [NGC 1365](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2023/104/01GS812G7AGRG6D1WCXPS3EYZ5), is visible on the upper right as a prominent Fornax cluster member.
