What's causing those unusual sky arcs? Ice crystals. While crossing a field of fresh snow near [FÃ¼ssen](https://youtu.be/5GjgTrY_cjA), [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany), earlier this month, the photographer noticed that he had entered an ice fog. For suspended water to freeze into an [ice fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_fog) requires quite cold temperatures, and indeed the air temperature on this day was measured at well below zero. The [ice fog](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211228.html) reflected light from the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) setting behind [St. Coleman Church](https://www.reddit.com/r/churches/comments/18h9p41/st_colemans_church_in_schwangau_ostallg%C3%A4u_bavaria/). The result was one of the [greatest spectacles](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/campaign_images/web05/2011/11/28/10/this-cat-is-totally-amazed-28550-1322493178-12.jpg?resize=600:*) the photographer has ever seen. First, the spots in the [featured picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0mLwRBN2Xf/) are not background stars but suspended ice and snow. Next, two prominent [ice halos](https://old.atoptics.co.uk/halosim.htm) are visible: the [22-degree halo](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210201.html) and the [46-degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46%C2%B0_halo) [halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(optical_phenomenon)). Multiple [arcs](https://old.atoptics.co.uk/halo/spsun.htm) are also [visible](https://old.atoptics.co.uk/halo/common.htm), including, from top to bottom, [antisolar](https://atoptics.wordpress.com/2014/05/09/the-mystery-of-bright-antisolar-arcs/) (subsun), [circumzenithal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumzenithal_arc), [Parry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parry_arc), [tangent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_arc), and [parhelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parhelic_circle) (horizontal). Finally, the [balloon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030606.html) shaped curve connecting the top arc to the Sun is the [rarest](https://old.atoptics.co.uk/halo/whyinfr.htm) of all: it is the [heliac arc](https://www.storyofsnow.com/blog1.php/a-rare-heliac-arc-plus-1), created by reflection from the sides of [hexagonally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_crystal#/media/File:Hexagonal_Ice_Crystals.svg) shaped [ice crystals](https://old.atoptics.co.uk/halo/platcol.htm) suspended in a horizontal orientation.
