This is a gibbous Moon. More [Earthlings](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080421.html) are familiar with a full moon, when the entire face of [Luna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_(goddess)) is lit by the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/), and a [crescent moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230527.html), when only a sliver of the [Moon's face](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html) is lit. When more than half of the Moon is illuminated, though, but still short of full illumination, the [phase](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-phases/) is called [gibbous](https://www.universetoday.com/20324/gibbous-moon/). Rarely seen in television and movies, [gibbous moon](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5048)s are quite common in the actual night sky. The [featured image](https://www.facebook.com/fotografgoranstrand/photos/a.10150527145460560/10156547207320560/?type=3&theater) was taken in [Jämtland](https://youtu.be/cu8UVfRtnuw), [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden) near the end of 2018 October. That [gibbous moon](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/G/Gibbous+Moon) turned, in a few days, into a crescent moon, and then a [new moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_moon), then back to a crescent, and a few days past that, back to gibbous. Setting up to capture a picturesque gibbous moonscape, the photographer was [quite surprised](https://i-h2.pinimg.com/564x/6f/6a/21/6f6a214624e5499b1cacfdaa88f28592.jpg) to find an airplane, [surely](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140113.html) well in the foreground, appearing to fly past it.
