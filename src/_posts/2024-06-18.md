Yes, but can your thunderstorm do this? Pictured here are [gigantic jets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190918.html) shooting up from a thunderstorm last week toward the [Himalayan Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas) in [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) and [Bhutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan). The composite image captured four long jets that occurred only minutes apart. [Gigantic jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper-atmospheric_lightning#Gigantic_jets), documented only in this century, are a type of lightning discharge that occurs between some [thunderstorms](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191204.html) and the Earth's [ionosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/10-things-to-know-about-the-ionosphere/) high above them. [They](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160823.html) are an unusual type of lightning that is much different from regular cloud-to-cloud and [cloud-to-ground lightning](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210524.html). The bottoms of [gigantic jets](https://www.realclearscience.com/quick_and_clear_science/2019/01/08/what_causes_earths_rare_and_mysterious_gigantic_jets.html) appear similar to a [cloud-to-above strike](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147900/bolts-of-blue) called [blue jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper-atmospheric_lightning#Blue_jets), while the tops appear similar to [upper-atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper-atmospheric_lightning) [red sprites](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210104.html). Although the mechanism and [trigger](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060814.html) that cause gigantic jets remains a [topic of research](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2400/1*Bp1dNLfyDjH2QCgALi-BrQ.jpeg), it is clear that the jets reduce charge imbalance between different parts of [Earth's atmosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/en/). A good way to look for [gigantic jets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AGUFMAE11A..02F/abstract) is to watch a powerful but [distant thunderstorm](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131110.html) from a clear location.
