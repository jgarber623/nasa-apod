This scene would be beautiful even without the comet. By itself, the [sunrise sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220924.html) is an elegant deep blue on high, with faint white stars peeking through, while near the horizon is a [pleasing](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Smiling-Cat.jpg) tan. By itself, the foreground hills of eastern [Slovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia) are appealingly green, with the Zadňa hura and Veľká hora hills in the distance, and with the lights of small towns along the way. [Venus](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/overview/), by itself on the right, appears [unusually exquisite](https://i.etsystatic.com/9751869/r/il/699fcc/2114310287/il_1140xN.2114310287_9si9.jpg), surrounded by a colorful atmospheric corona. But what attracts the eye most is the [comet](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/). On the left, in [this composite image](https://www.petrhoralek.com/?p=23774) taken just before dawn yesterday morning, is [Comet Nishimura](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=C%2F2023%20P1). On recent mornings around the globe, its [bright](https://theskylive.com/comets) [coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_(comet)) and long ion [tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_tail) make many a morning panoramic photo unusually beautiful. Tomorrow, [C/2023 P1 (Nishimura)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_P1_(Nishimura)) will pass its nearest to the Earth for about the next 434 years.
