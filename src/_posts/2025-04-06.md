Why are there so many moonquakes? Analyses of [seismometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer) left on the moon during the [Apollo moon landings](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apolloland.html) reveal a surprising number of [moonquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_\(natural_phenomenon\)#Moonquake)s occurring within 100 kilometers of the surface. In fact, 62 [moonquakes](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977Sci...196..979T/abstract) were detected in data recorded between 1972 and 1977. [Many of these moonquakes](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/moonquakes/) are not only strong enough to [move furniture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A75icqf9M6w) in a [lunar apartment](https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/missions/2020/10/28/lunar-living-nasas-artemis-base-camp-concept/), but the stiff rock of the moon continues to vibrate for many minutes, significantly longer than the softer rock [earthquakes](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/) on [Earth](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg). The cause of the moonquakes remains unknown, but a [leading hypothesis](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017JGRE..122.1487K/abstract) include [tidal gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force) from -- and [relative heating](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/21/aa/a2/21aaa23cfe7dbdd0a2201d68c94c1dbf.jpg) by -- our Earth. Regardless of the source, [future moon dwellings](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171025.html) need to be built to withstand the frequent shakings. [Pictured here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/9457418581/in/album-72157634973926806/), [Apollo 11](https://www.nasa.gov/history/apollo-11-mission-overview/) astronaut [Buzz Aldrin](https://www.nasa.gov/former-astronaut-edwin-buzz-aldrin/) stands beside a recently deployed [lunar seismometer](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/apollo-11-seismic-experiment/), looking back toward the [lunar landing module](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030920.html).
