Why are these clouds multi-colored? A relatively rare phenomenon in clouds known as [iridescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_iridescence) can bring up unusual colors vividly -- or even a whole [spectrum](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro/) of colors simultaneously. These [polar stratospheric clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_stratospheric_cloud) [also](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_iridescence), known as [nacreous](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200110.html) and mother-of-pearl clouds, are formed of small [water droplets](https://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/clouds.htm) of nearly uniform size. When the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) is in the right position and, typically, hidden from direct view, [these thin clouds](http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wxwise/class/iredsnce.html) can be seen significantly [diffracting](http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/diffraction/index.html) sunlight in a nearly coherent manner, with [different colors](https://youtu.be/VljrlBkJUl0) being deflected by different amounts. Therefore, [different colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence) will come to the observer from slightly [different directions](http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/many_different_directions.jpg). Many [clouds](https://scijinks.gov/rainbow-clouds/) start with uniform regions that could show [iridescence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140708.html) but quickly become too thick, too mixed, or too angularly far from the [Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/) to exhibit striking colors. The featured image and an [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/VljrlBkJUl0) were taken late in 2019 over [Ostersund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0z1BqhtyLA), [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden).
