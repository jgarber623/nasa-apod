What will happen as this already bright comet approaches? Optimistic predictions have [Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan–ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_\(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS\)) briefly becoming easily visible to the unaided eye -- although the future brightness of [comet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131117.html)s are notoriously [hard to predict](https://emusements.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cat-doh.jpg), and this comet may even [break up](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230903.html) in warming sunlight. What is certain is that the comet is now unexpectedly bright and is [on track](https://theskylive.com/3dsolarsystem?obj=c2023a3) to pass its closest to the Sun (0.39 [AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit)) later this week and closest to the [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) (0.47 AU) early next month. The [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/jt8z8x/B/) was taken in late May as [Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS](https://www.seti.org/will-comet-c2023-a3-tsuchinshan-atlas-be-comet-decade), discovered only last year, passed nearly in front of two [distant galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210802.html). The [comet can now be found](https://earthsky.org/space/comet-c-2023-a3-sep-oct-2024-tsuchinshan-atlas/) with binoculars in the early morning sky rising just before the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/), while over the next few weeks it [will brighten](http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2023A3/2023A3.html) as it moves to the early evening sky.
