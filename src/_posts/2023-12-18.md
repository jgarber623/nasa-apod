Are squares A and B the same color? They are! To verify this, either run your cursor over the image or click [here](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0707/samecolor_wikipedia_connected.jpg) to see them connected. The [featured illusion](https://michaelbach.de/ot/lum-adelsonCheckShadow/), an example of the [same color illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_color_illusion), illustrates that purely human perceptions in science may be [ambiguous](https://www.quora.com/Optical-Illusions/What-are-some-great-optical-illusions) or inaccurate, even such a seemingly direct [perception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8U0YPHxiFQ) as relative color. Similar [illusions](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121003.html) exist on the [sky](https://www.facebook.com/APOD.Sky), such as the [size of the Moon near the horizon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090616.html), or the [apparent shapes of astronomical objects](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190211.html). The advent of automated, reproducible measuring devices such as [CCDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device) have made [science](https://science.nasa.gov/) in general and [astronomy](https://www.iau.org/public/themes/astronomy_in_everyday_life/) in particular less prone to, but not free of, [human-biased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8Zz05t19dg) [illusions](https://www.michaelbach.de/ot/).
