What's happening in the sky this unusual night? Most striking in the featured 4.5-hour 360-degree [panoramic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panorama) video, perhaps, is the pink and purple [aurora](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/en/). That's because this night, encompassing May 11, was [famous](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152815/historic-geomagnetic-storm-dazzles) for its [auroral skies around the world](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.431368006258449&type=3). As the night progresses, [auroral bands shimmer](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130609.html), the [central band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240529.html) of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) rises, and [stars shift](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010110.html) as the [Earth rotates](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200701.html) beneath them. Captured here simultaneously is a rare red band running above the aurora: a [SAR arc](https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2021/11/22/3308/), seen to change only slightly. The flashing below the horizon is caused by passing cars, while the moving spots in the sky are satellites and airplanes. The featured video was captured from [Xinjiang](https://youtu.be/63fmzduUDKM), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) with [four separate](https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/06/96/34/50/360_F_696345047_CEFfcTYtHF1L5sZrayzOlJzBo648stCR.jpg) cameras.
