What's happened since the universe started? The time spiral [shown here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nature_timespiral_vertical_layout.png) features a few [notable highlights](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171126.html). At the spiral's center is the [Big Bang](https://webb.nasa.gov/content/features/bigBangQandA.html), the place where [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time), as we know it, began about 13.8 billion years ago. Within a few billion years [atoms formed](https://youtu.be/cx1z0jwzWjI), then [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/) formed from atoms, [galaxies formed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230531.html) from stars and gas, [our Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) formed, soon followed by [our Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/), about 4.6 billion years ago. [Life on Earth](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/about/life_on_earth.html) begins about 3.8 billion years ago, followed by [cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087693/), then [photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis) within a billion years. About 1.7 billion years ago, [multicellular life](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/how-did-multicellular-life-evolve/) on Earth began to flourish. [Fish began to swim](https://youtu.be/t6ORDd4ZpXg) about 500 million years ago, and [mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal) because walking on land about 200 million years ago. [Humans](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190818.html) first appeared only about 6 million years ago, and made the [first cities](https://youtu.be/H1jHdnZ2U3o) only about 10,000 years ago. The time spiral illustrated stops there, but human [spaceflight](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181001.html) might be added, which started only 75 years ago, and useful [artificial intelligence](https://media.snopes.com/2009/01/rand.jpg) began to take hold within only the past few years.
