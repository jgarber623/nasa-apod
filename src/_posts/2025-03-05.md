On the right, dressed in blue, is the [Pleiades](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap950620.html). Also known as the [Seven Sisters](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/what-are-pleiades) and [M45](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades), [the Pleiades](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211124.html) is one of the brightest and [most easily visible](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170314.html) [open clusters](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/open_clusters.html) on the sky. [The Pleiades](https://earthsky.org/favorite-star-patterns/pleiades-star-cluster-enjoys-worldwide-renown/) contains over 3,000 stars, is about 400 light years away, and only 13 light years across. [Surrounding the stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200323.html) is a spectacular blue [reflection nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_nebula) made of fine [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/glossary.html#dust). [A common legend](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.1592) is that one of the brighter stars faded since the cluster was named. On the left, shining in red, is the [California Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060924.html). Named for its shape, the [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California) Nebula is much dimmer and hence harder to see than [the Pleiades](https://youtu.be/V0qMKgeVR5M). Also known as [NGC 1499](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Nebula), this mass of red glowing hydrogen gas is about 1,500 [light years](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) away. Although about 25 full moons could fit [between them](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090411.html), the [featured wide angle, deep field image composite](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGREz_SpZIL/) has captured [them](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960618.html) [both](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090212.html). A [careful inspection](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/30/20/56019439-10669595-This_adorable_tiny_kitten_who_is_entranced_by_the_computer_scree-m-73_1648669189326.jpg) of the deep image will also reveal the star forming region [IC 348](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151010.html) and the [molecular cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud) [LBN 777](https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-lbn777/) (the Baby Eagle Nebula).
