What's happening near the Sun? To help find out, NASA [launch](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180815.html)[ed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180816.html) the robotic [Parker Solar Probe](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/) (PSP) to [investigate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VO5GcfgCz8) regions closer to the Sun than ever before. The [PSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe)'s looping [orbit](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4653) brings it nearer to the Sun [each time around](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe#Timeline) -- every few months. The [featured time-lapse video](https://wispr.nrl.navy.mil/encounter16-summary) shows the view looking sideways from [behind PSP](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03665-3)'s Sun shield during its 16th approach to the Sun last year -- from well within the orbit of [Mercury](https://science.nasa.gov/mercury/). The [PSP](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/parker-solar-probe/)'s Wide Field Imager for Solar Probe ([WISPR](https://wispr.nrl.navy.mil/)) cameras took the images over eleven days, but they are digitally compressed here into about one minute video. The waving of the [solar corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190130.html) is visible, as is a [coronal mass ejection](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160110.html), with stars, planets, and even the central band of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/milkyway1.html) streaming by in the background as the PSP orbits the Sun. [PSP has found](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasas-parker-solar-probe-sheds-new-light-on-the-sun) the solar neighborhood to be [surprisingly complex](https://i0.wp.com/puppytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Messy_Dog_11.jpg) and to include [switchbacks](https://www.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/switchbacks-science-explaining-parker-solar-probes-magnetic-puzzle/) -- times when the [Sun's magnetic field](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/main/item/37) briefly reverses itself.
