Globular star cluster [Omega Centauri](https://earthsky.org/clusters-nebulae-galaxies/omega-centauri-milky-ways-prize-star-cluster), also known as NGC 5139, is 15,000 light-years away. The cluster is [packed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080906.html) with about 10 million stars much older than the Sun within a volume about 150 light-years in diameter. It's the largest and brightest of 200 or so known [globular clusters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_clusters) that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy. Though most star clusters consist of stars with the same age and composition, the enigmatic Omega Cen exhibits the presence of [different](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...653L...8L/abstract) stellar populations with a spread of ages and chemical abundances. In fact, [Omega Cen may be](https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/html/heic0809.html) the [remnant](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019NatAs...3..667I/abstract) core of a small galaxy merging with the Milky Way. With a [yellowish hue](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151224.html), Omega Centauri's red giant stars are easy to pick out in this [sharp, color telescopic view](https://www.astrobin.com/bc7qq5/0/).
