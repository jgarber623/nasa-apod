Why is the Cigar Galaxy billowing red smoke? [M82](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_82), as this [starburst galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starburst_galaxy) is also known, was stirred up by a [recent pass](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160203.html) near large [spiral](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/spiral_galaxies.html) galaxy [M81](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210312.html). This doesn't fully explain the source of the red-glowing outwardly [expanding gas](https://youtu.be/WOLUDpYhzp0?t=34) and dust, however. [Evidence](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJ...523..575L/abstract) indicates that this gas and dust is being driven out by the combined emerging [particle winds](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/news-articles/effects-of-the-solar-wind) of many stars, together creating a galactic [superwind](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Heckman/frames.html). The dust particles are [thought to originate](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PASJ...71...87Y/abstract) in M82's interstellar medium and are actually [similar in size](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26058972) to particles in cigar smoke. The [featured photographic mosaic](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvIxl-4SVbs/) highlights a [specific color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha) of red light strongly emitted by ionized [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) gas, showing detailed filaments of this gas and dust. The filaments extend for over 10,000 [light year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/)s. The 12-million light-year distant [Cigar Galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040601.html) is the brightest galaxy in the sky in [infrared](https://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/page/what_is_infrared) light and can be seen in visible light with a small [telescope](https://www.howstuffworks.com/telescope.htm) [towards](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110624.html) the [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/) of the Great Bear ([Ursa Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major)).
