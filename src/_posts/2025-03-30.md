What if the Sun and Moon rose together? That [happened yesterday](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/mar-29-2025-eclipse/) over some northern parts of [planet Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) as a [partial solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/types/) occurred shortly after sunrise. Regions that experienced the Moon blocking part of the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) included northeastern parts of [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) and northwestern parts of [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia), and [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa). The featured image was captured yesterday over the [Grábrók](https://youtu.be/ZxIPyR6-bko) volcanic crater in [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland) where much of the Sun became momentarily hidden behind the Moon. The image was taken through a cloudy sky but [so well planned](https://catastic.pet/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fluffy-kitten-with-glasses-book-blue-background-cat-scientist-school-concept.jpg) that the photographer's friend appeared to be pulling the Sun out from behind the Moon. No part of the Earth experienced a [total solar eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240310.html) this time. In the distant past, some of humanity was so surprised when an eclipse occurred that ongoing [battles suddenly stopped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_of_Thales). Today, eclipses are not a surprise and are [predicted with an accuracy](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/accuracy.html) of seconds.
