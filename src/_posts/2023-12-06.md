It's stars versus dust in the Carina Nebula and the stars are winning. More precisely, the [energetic light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/) and [wind](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000318.html)s from massive newly formed [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/) are evaporating and dispersing the [dusty stellar nurseries](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220314.html) in which they formed. Located in the [Carina Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190623.html) and inside a region known informally as [Mystic Mountain](https://esahubble.org/images/heic1007a/), these pillars' appearance is dominated by opaque brown dust even though it is composed mostly of clear [hydrogen](http://apod.nasa.gov/rjn/apod/lib/lament.html) gas. Even though some of the [dust pillar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211214.html)s look like [torches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch), their ends are not on [fire](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180826.html) -- rather, they are illuminated by nearby stars. About 7,500 light-years distant, the featured image was taken with the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://hubblesite.org/mission-and-telescope) and highlights an interior region of Carina known as [HH1066](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/HST-WFC3-Imaging-of-Protostellar-Jets-in-Carina%3A-Reiter-Smith/71a6e0755f3b9ec46ca909c34ff0d3b282c6be00/figure/6) which spans nearly a [light year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/). Within a few million years, the stars will likely [win out](https://www.barnorama.com/wp-content/images/2013/01/Cats-Standing/30-Cats-Standing.jpg) completely and the dust torches will completely [evaporate](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/avgUGHv2Sl4).
