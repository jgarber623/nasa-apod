[Not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27s_paradox) a paradox, [Comet 13P/Olbers is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13P/Olbers) returning to the inner [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/) after 68 years. The periodic, [Halley-type](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/H/Halley-Type+Comets) comet will reach its next perihelion or closest approach to the Sun on June 30 and has become a target for binocular viewing low in [planet](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11038-005-9023-0) Earth's northern hemisphere [night skies](https://theskylive.com/13p-info). But this sharp telescopic image of 13P is composed of stacked exposures made on the night of June 25. It easily reveals shifting details in the bright comet's torn and tattered ion tail [buffeted](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220110.html) by the wind from an active Sun, along with a [broad, fanned-out](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240604.html) dust tail and slightly greenish coma. [The frame spans over two degrees](https://www.astrobin.com/61712u/C/) across a background of faint stars toward the constellation Lynx.
