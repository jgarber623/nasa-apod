Over 500,000 light years across, [NGC 6872](http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso9924b/) (top right) is a truly [enormous barred spiral galaxy](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007A%26A...464..155H/abstract), at least 5 times the size of our own very large Milky Way. The appearance of this [giant galaxy's](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110403.html) distorted and stretched out spiral arms suggests the magnificent wings of a giant bird. Of course its popular moniker is the Condor galaxy. It lies about 200 million light-years distant toward the southern constellation Pavo, the Peacock. Lined with [star-forming regions](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...691.1921M/abstract), the distorted spiral arms are due to NGC 6872's gravitational interaction with the nearby smaller [galaxy IC 4970](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/ngc6872/), seen just above the giant galaxy's core. [The Pavo galaxy group's](https://www.astroexplorer.org/details/apj296376f1) dominant giant elliptical galaxy, NGC 6876 is below and left of the soaring Condor galaxy.
