Immersed in an eerie greenish light, this rugged [little planet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210305.html) appears to be home to stunning water falls and an impossibly tall mountain. [It's planet Earth](https://gis.earthdata.nasa.gov/portal/apps/sites/#/earth-information-center) of course. On the night of November 9 the nadir-centered 360 degree mosaic was [captured by digital camera](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz3ne8SL6tA/) from the [Kirkjufell mountain area](https://www.google.com/maps/@64.9406563,-23.2972301,13z?entry=ttu) of western Iceland. Curtains of [shimmering Aurora Borealis](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231117.html) or Northern Lights provide the pale greenish illumination. The intense auroral display was caused by solar activity that rocked [Earth's magnetosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/planetary-science/earths-magnetosphere/) in early November and produced strong geomagnetic storms. Kirkjufell mountain itself stands at the top of the [stereographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection) projection's circular horizon. Northern hemisphere skygazers will recognize the familiar stars of the Big Dipper just above Kirkjufell's peak. At lower right the compact Pleiades star cluster and truly giant [planet Jupiter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231124.html) also shine in this little planet's night sky.
