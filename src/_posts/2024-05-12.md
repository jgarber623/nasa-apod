Northern lights don't usually reach this far south. Magnetic chaos in the Sun's [huge Active Region 3664](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240511.html), however, produced a surface explosion that sent a [burst](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031029.html) of electrons, protons, and more massive, charged nuclei into the [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/facts/). A few days later, that [coronal mass ejection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection) (CME) impacted the Earth and [triggered auroras](https://www.facebook.com/media/set?set=a.431368006258449&type=3) that are being reported unusually far from our planet's [north and south poles](https://climatekids.nasa.gov/polar-temperatures/). The free sky show [might not be over](https://www.universetoday.com/166942/if-youve-never-seen-an-aurora-before-this-might-be-your-chance/) -- the sunspot rich [AR3664](https://skyandtelescope.org/online-gallery/ar3664-ginormous-active-sunspot-area/) has ejected even more [CME](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/what-coronal-mass-ejection-or-cme/)s that might also impact the [Earth tonight or tomorrow](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/geomagnetic-storming-likely-persist-weekend). That active region is now [near the Sun's edge](https://www.spaceweather.com/images2024/11may24/hmi1898.gif), though, and will soon be rotating away from the [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161010.html). Pictured, a [red](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220220.html) and [rayed aurora](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080101.html) was captured in a single 6-second exposure from [Racib√≥rz](https://youtu.be/bMf--MCsLLY), [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland) early last night. The photographer's friend, seeing an aurora [for the first time](https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/01/89/49/89/1000_F_189498933_OeutsN0mMlzJGaJZJvkXIsoSCUCFIO7W.jpg), is visible in the distance also taking images of the [beautifully colorful](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231227.html) nighttime sky.
