Is this one galaxy or two? Although it looks like one, the answer is two. One path to this happening is when a small [galaxy](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/galaxy/en/) collides with a larger galaxy and [ends up in the center](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201018.html). But in the [featured image](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/03/Webb_spies_a_spiral_through_a_cosmic_lens), something [more rare](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/2jqsdk/the_omg_cat/#lightbox) is going on. Here, the central light-colored [elliptical galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/galaxies/types/#elliptical-galaxies) is much closer than the blue and red-colored [spiral galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/galaxies/types/#spiral-galaxies) that surrounds it. This can happen when near and far galaxies are [exactly aligned](https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stsci-h-p2005b-f-4096x2160-1-jpg.webp), causing the gravity of the near galaxy to pull the light from the far galaxy around it in an effect called [gravitational lensing](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-behind-the-discoveries/hubble-gravitational-lenses/). The [featured galaxy double](https://esawebb.org/images/potm2503a/) was taken by the [Webb Space Telescope](https://webbtelescope.org/home) and shows a complete [Einstein ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160420.html), with great detail visible for both galaxies. Galaxy [lenses like this](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220705.html) can reveal new information about the [mass distribution](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-highlights/shining-a-light-on-dark-matter/) of the foreground lens and the [light distribution](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/newly-discovered-gravitational-lenses-could-reveal-ancient-galaxies-and-nature-dark-matter) of the background source.
