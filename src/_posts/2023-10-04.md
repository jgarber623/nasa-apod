Does this nebula look like the head of a witch? The nebula is [known popularly](https://earthsky.org/todays-image/witch-head-nebula-orion/) as the Witch Head Nebula because, it is said, the nebula's shape resembles a [Halloween-style caricature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween#/media/File:Halloween_Witch_2011.JPG) of a witch's head. Exactly how, though, can be a topic of imaginative speculation. What is clear is that [IC 2118](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_2118) is about 50 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) across and made of gas and dust that points to -- because it has been partly eroded by -- the nearby star [Rigel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel). One of the brighter stars in the constellation Orion, [Rigel](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230407.html) lies below the bottom of the [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/CqdsZ47M7xc/). The blue color of the Witch Head Nebula and is caused not only by [Rigel's intense blue starlight](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220124.html) but because the [dust grains](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/dust/) scatter blue light more efficiently than red. The same [physical process](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/blusky.html) causes Earth's daytime [sky to appear blue](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/), although the scatterers in planet [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/earths-atmospheric-layers-3/) are molecules of [nitrogen](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/nasas-curiosity-rover-finds-biologically-useful-nitrogen-on-mars/) and [oxygen](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/lightning-oxygen-and-life-detection/).
