This was once a beach -- on ancient [Mars](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/). The [featured 360-degree panorama](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11241), [horizontally compressed](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/62/f1/fe/62f1fe59e5e8ed26d724f701adc5be0b.jpg), was taken in 2017 by the robotic [Curiosity rover](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/rover/) that explored the [red planet](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/goddard/nasa-new-study-on-why-mars-is-red-supports-potentially-habitable-past/). Named Ogunquit Beach after its [terrestrial counterpart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NUOfTyFumg), evidence shows that at times long ago the area was underwater, while at other times it was at the edge of an [ancient lake](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-rover-team-confirms-ancient-lakes-on-mars/). The light peak in the central background is the top of [Mount Sharp](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120827.html), the central feature in [Gale Crater](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110729.html) where Curiosity explored. Portions of the [dark sands](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160119.html) in the foreground were [scooped up](http://redplanet.asu.edu/?p=23396) for analysis. The light colored [bedrock](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040127.html) is composed of [sediment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment) that likely settled at the bottom of the now-dried lakebed. The [featured](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11241) panorama ([interactive version here](https://youtu.be/V3qr9AqZyEI)) was created from over 100 images and seemingly signed by the rover on the lower left.
