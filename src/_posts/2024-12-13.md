An intriguing pair of interacting galaxies, M51 is [the 51st entry](http://messier.obspm.fr/m/m051.html) in Charles Messier's famous catalog. Perhaps the [original spiral nebula](http://messier.seds.org/more/m051_rosse.html), the large galaxy with whirlpool-like spiral structure seen nearly face-on is also cataloged as NGC 5194. Its [spiral arms and dust lanes](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-51-the-whirlpool-galaxy) sweep in front of its smaller companion galaxy, [NGC 5195](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130831.html). Some 31 million light-years distant, within the boundaries of the well-trained constellation [Canes Venatici](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cvn/index.html), M51 looks faint and fuzzy to the eye in direct telescopic views. [But this remarkably deep image](https://www.astrobin.com/5nb17v/) shows off stunning details of the galaxy pair's striking colors and fainter [tidal streams](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...800L...3W/abstract). The image includes extensive narrowband data to highlight a vast reddish cloud of ionized hydrogen gas recently [discovered in the M51 system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01699) and known to some as the [H-alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-alpha) cliffs. Foreground dust clouds in the Milky Way and distant background galaxies are captured in the wide-field view. A continuing [collaboration of astro-imagers](https://deepskycollective.com/gallery) using telescopes on planet Earth assembled over 3 weeks of exposure time to create this evolving portrait of M51.
