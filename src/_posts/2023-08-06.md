What created this unusual space ribbon? The answer: one of the most [violent explosions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova) ever [witnessed](https://www.sadanduseless.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/funny-suprised-cat2.jpg) by ancient humans. Back in the year 1006 AD, light reached Earth from a [stellar explosion](https://youtu.be/BukKR_41r9g) in the constellation of the Wolf ([Lupus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupus_(constellation))), creating a "guest star" in the sky that appeared brighter than [Venus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230306.html) and lasted for over two years. The supernova, now cataloged at [SN 1006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1006), occurred about 7,000 light years away and has left a large remnant that [continues to expand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1006#/media/File:SN_1006_Remnant_Expansion_Comparison.jpeg) and fade today. [Pictured here](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2008/22/2351-Image.html) is a small part of that [expanding supernova](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140712.html) [remnant](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2008/news-2008-22.html) dominated by a [thin](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030317.html) and outwardly moving [shock](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220522.html) front that heats and ionizes surrounding ambient gas. The [supernova remnant SN 1006](https://youtu.be/hAMIqzvpZDc) now has a diameter of nearly 60 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/).
