What would it look like to circle a black hole? If the [black hole](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/) was surrounded by a [swirling disk of glowing and accreting gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190820.html), then the great gravity of the black hole would [deflect light](https://www.phy.mtu.edu/bht/rjn_bht.html) emitted by the disk to make it look very unusual. The [featured animated video](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13326) gives a visualization. The video starts with you, [the observer](https://images.freeimages.com/images/large-previews/755/dog-looking-at-the-camera-1411251.jpg), looking toward the [black hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240505.html) from just above the plane of the accretion disk. Surrounding the central [black hole](https://jila.colorado.edu/news-events/articles/what-happens-when-you-fall-black-hole) is a thin circular image of the orbiting disk that marks the position of the [photon sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere) -- inside of which lies the black hole's [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon). Toward the left, parts of the large main image of the disk [appear brighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_(astronomy)) as they move toward you. As [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l36UkYtq6m0) continues, you loop over the [black hole](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993AmJPh..61..619N/abstract), soon looking down from the top, then passing through the disk plane on the far side, then returning to your [original vantage point](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2008/BhAccretionDisk_NasaSchnittman_3851_annotated.jpg). The accretion disk does some interesting [image inversions](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141026.html) -- but never appears flat. Visualizations such as this are particularly relevant today as [black holes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190411.html) are [being imaged](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240401.html) in [unprecedented detail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220513.html) by the [Event Horizon Telescope](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/).
