[Eclipses tend to come in pairs.](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/may-june-2021-special-eclipse-season/) Twice a year, during an eclipse season that lasts about 34 days, Sun, Moon, and Earth can nearly align. Then the full and new [phases of the Moon](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4874), separated by just over 14 days, create a lunar and a solar eclipse. But only rarely is the alignment at both new moon and full moon phases during a single eclipse season close enough to produce a pair with both total (or a total and an annular) lunar and solar eclipses. More often, partial eclipses are part of any eclipse season. In fact, the last eclipse season of 2024 produced this fortnight-separated eclipse pair: a [partial lunar eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240920.html) on 18 September and an [annular solar eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241008.html) on 2 October. The time-lapse composite images were captured from Somerset, UK (left) and [Rapa Nui](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241011.html) planet Earth. The [2025 eclipse seasons](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/2025) will see a total lunar eclipse on 14 March paired with a partial solar eclipse on 29 March, and a total lunar eclipse on 8 September followed by a partial solar eclipse on 21 September.
