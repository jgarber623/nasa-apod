[Bright Mars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240802.html) and even brighter Jupiter are in close conjunction just above the pine trees in this post-midnight skyscape from [Vallentuna](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150319.html), Sweden. Taken on August 12 during a geomagnetic storm, the snapshot records the glow of aurora borealis or northern lights, beaming from the left side of the frame. Of course on [that date Perseid meteors](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/perseids/) rained through planet Earth's skies, grains of dust from the shower's parent, periodic comet [Swift-Tuttle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240808.html). The meteor streak at the upper right is a Perseid plowing through the atmosphere at about 60 kilometers per _second_. Also well-known in in Earth's night sky, the bright Pleides star cluster shines below the Perseid meteor streak. In Greek myth, the Pleiades were [seven daughters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades_\(Greek_mythology\)) of the astronomical titan Atlas and sea-nymph Pleione. The Pleiades and their parents' names are given to the cluster's nine brightest stars.
