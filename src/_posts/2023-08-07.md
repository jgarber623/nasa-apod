The Pelican Nebula is slowly being transformed. IC 5070 (the official designation) is divided from the larger [North America Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000501.html) by a [molecular cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html) filled with dark [dust](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/stardust/interstellardust.cfm). The [Pelican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican), however, receives much study because it is a particularly active mix of [star formation](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201206.html) and evolving gas clouds. The [featured picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvXy7lgL8CS/) was produced in three specific colors -- light emitted by [sulfur](https://periodic.lanl.gov/16.shtml), [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen), and [oxygen](http://www.chemicool.com/elements/oxygen.html) -- that can help us to better understand these interactions. The light from young energetic stars is slowly transforming the cold gas to hot gas, with the [advancing boundary](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180205.html) between the two, known as an [ionization front](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031013.html), visible in bright orange on the right. Particularly dense [tentacles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tentacle#/media/File:Snail-front-0A.jpg) of cold gas remain. Millions of years from now, the [Pelican](https://youtu.be/_YEyzvtMx3s) nebula, bounded by dark nebula [LDN 935](https://www.astrobin.com/co5g86/B/?nc=group&nce=144), might no longer be known as the [Pelican](http://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=Pelican), as the [balance and placement of stars and gas](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980ApJ...239..121B/abstract) will surely leave something that appears [completely different](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-03/9/6/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-18669-1520596548-8.jpg).
