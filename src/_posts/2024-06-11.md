Why is the sky near [Antares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antares) and [Rho Ophiuchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho_Ophiuchi_cloud_complex) so colorful, yet dusty? The colors result from a mixture of objects and processes. Fine dust -- illuminated by starlight -- produces blue [reflection nebulae](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/reflection_nebulae.html). Gaseous clouds whose atoms are [excited](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5f/02/9e/5f029e83ee5a6c667a6a70cb18202307.jpg) by [ultraviolet](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) starlight produce reddish [emission nebulae](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210214.html). Backlit [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html) clouds block starlight and so [appear dark](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html). [Antares](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/antares.html), a [red supergiant](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/redsup.html) and one of the [brighter stars in the night sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars#Table), lights up the yellow-red clouds on the upper right of the featured image. The [Rho Ophiuchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho_Ophiuchi) star system lies at the center of the blue [reflection nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_nebula) on the left, while a different reflection nebula, [IC 4605](https://www.astrobin.com/migind/C/), [lies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090615.html) just below and right of the image center. These star clouds are even more [colorful](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/color-your-universe-game/en/) than [humans](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190818.html) can see, emitting light across the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro).
