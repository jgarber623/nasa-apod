Do [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve) always create jets as they form? No one is sure. As a gas cloud [gravitationally contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation#Cloud_collapse), it forms a [disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap991219.html) that can spin too fast to continue contracting into a [protostar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar). Theorists [hypothesize](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...816...32J/abstract) that this spin can be reduced by expelling jets. This speculation coincides with known [Herbig-Haro (HH) objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbig%E2%80%93Haro_object), young stellar objects seen to emit jets -- sometimes in [spectacular fashion](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180311.html). [Pictured](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2023/141/01H9NWH9JEBFPKVD3M1RRTGGQJ) is Herbig-Haro 211, a young star in formation [recently imaged](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-141) by the [Webb Space Telescope](https://webbtelescope.org/) (JWST) in [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) and in [great detail](https://i0.hippopx.com/photos/807/839/788/cat-pet-cat-cat-maine-coon-cat-preview.jpg). Along with the [two narrow beams of particles](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200525.html), red [shock waves](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200202.html) can be seen as the outflows impact [existing interstellar gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100829.html). The jets of [HH 221](https://iaaa.org/herbig-haro-hh-211/) will likely change shape as they brighten and fade over the next 100,000 years, as research into the details of [star formation](https://hubblesite.org/science/stars-and-nebulas) continues.
