[Gamma Cassiopeiae](https://www.aavso.org/vsots_gammacas) shines high in northern autumn evening skies. It's the brightest spiky star in this telescopic field of view toward the constellation Cassiopeia. [Gamma Cas shares the ethereal-looking scene](https://www.astrobin.com/k5f7nk/0/) with ghostly interstellar clouds of gas and dust, IC 59 (top left) and IC 63. About 600 light-years distant, [the clouds](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2018/news-2018-42.html) aren't actually ghosts. They are slowly disappearing though, eroding under the influence of [energetic radiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01419) from hot and luminous gamma Cas. [Gamma Cas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_Cassiopeiae) is physically located only 3 to 4 light-years from the nebulae. Slightly closer to gamma Cas, IC 63 is dominated by [red H-alpha light emitted](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111013.html) as hydrogen atoms ionized by the star's ultraviolet radiation recombine with electrons. Farther from the star, IC 59 shows proportionally less H-alpha emission but more of the characteristic blue tint of dust [reflected star light](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap091126.html). The cosmic stage spans over 1 degree or 10 light-years at the estimated distance of [gamma Cas and friends](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04313).
