The [Ring Nebula (M57)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_nebula) is more complicated than it appears through a small telescope. The easily visible [central ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230402.html) is about one [light-year](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) across, but [this remarkably deep exposure](http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/M57-HST-LBT.html) - a [collaborative effort](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t8tjT9MA7yU/hqdefault.jpg) combining data from three different large telescopes - [explores](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...417..637C/abstract) the looping filaments of glowing gas extending much farther from [the nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210721.html)'s central star. This [composite image](http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/M57-HST-LBT.html) includes red light emitted by hydrogen as well as visible and [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves). The Ring Nebula is an elongated [planetary nebula](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/p/Planetary+Nebulae), a type of nebula created when a [Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230611.html)\-like star evolves to [throw off its outer atmosphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FSIfUYFeTM) and become a [white dwarf star](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/dwarfs2.html). The [Ring Nebula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiYRL3HFULU) is about 2,500 light-years away toward the musical [constellation Lyra](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/lyr/index.html).
