Most photographs don't adequately portray the magnificence of the [Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/)'s corona. Seeing the [corona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona) first-hand during a total [solar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_solar_eclipse) is [unparalleled](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170912.html). The [human eye](http://iknow.net/phys_eye_education.html) can adapt to see coronal [features](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170813.html) and [extent](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160412.html) that average cameras usually cannot. Welcome, however, to the [digital](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990426.html) age. The featured image [digitally combined](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170830.html) short and long exposures taken in [Exmouth](https://youtu.be/9qT2nt1_8JA), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) that were processed to highlight faint and extended features in the corona during the total solar eclipse that occurred in [April of 2023](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2023-april-20). Clearly visible are [intricate layers](https://scontent-ord5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/64310547_1612916445509927_1944194861536116736_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=WgR3f8nLRLEAX88R2kb&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.xx&oh=00_AfBFBuLRuHfmOzrOTqy9WnhBvUvbomQO463x15v0RPv6FQ&oe=6488417C) and glowing caustics of an ever changing mixture of hot gas and [magnetic fields](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/understanding-the-magnetic-sun) in the Sun's corona. [Looping prominences](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090531.html) appear bright pink just past the Sun's [edge](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080807.html). Images taken seconds before and after the total eclipse show glimpses of the background Sun known as [Baily's Beads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baily%27s_beads) and [diamond ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170825.html) effect. The next total [solar eclipse](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/eclipse-snap/en/) will cross [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) in [April of 2024](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230418.html).
