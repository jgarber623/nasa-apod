What are those strange rings? Rich in dust, the rings are likely 3D shells -- but _how_ they were created remains a [topic of research](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...979L...3L/abstract). _Where_ they were created is well known: in a [binary star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star) system that lies about 6,000 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) away toward the [constellation of the Swan](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/cygnus.html) (Cygnus) -- a system dominated by the Wolf-Rayet star [WR 140](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WR_140). [Wolf-Rayet stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet_star) are massive, bright, and known for their [tumultuous winds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200308.html). They are also known for creating and dispersing heavy [elements](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230108.html) such as [carbon](https://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml), which is a building block of interstellar [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html). The other star in the [binary](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970219.html) is also bright and massive -- but [not as active](https://www.purina.co.uk/sites/default/files/2020-12/How%20Long%20Do%20Cats%20SleepTEASER.jpg). The two [great stars](https://www.sciencealert.com/extraordinary-phenomenon-in-space-captured-by-spellbinding-new-image) [joust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jousting) in an [oblong orbit](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/videos/2025/103/01JGPEDKQ9R00SN0G5S1Z14P1J) as they approach each other about every eight years. When at closest approach, the [X-ray](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays) [emission from the system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022HEAD...1911098C/abstract) increases, as, apparently, does the dust expelled into space -- creating [another shell](https://youtu.be/ssJ_I5loCbc?list=PLTiv_XWHnOZpegG_WpYvUvvAegH7e02Aw). The [featured](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2025/news-2025-103) [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) [image](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/star-duo-forms-fingerprint-in-space-nasa-s-webb-finds) by the [Webb Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/webb/about/index.html) resolves [greater details](https://youtu.be/4lQy8v-BWNw) and [more dust shells](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WR140.png) than ever before. Images taken over consecutive years show the [shells moving outward](https://youtu.be/_rRRhieyxAU).
