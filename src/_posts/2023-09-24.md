What's rising above the horizon behind those clouds? It's the Sun. Most sunrises don't look [like this](https://i0.hippopx.com/photos/807/839/788/cat-pet-cat-cat-maine-coon-cat-preview.jpg), though, because most sunrises don't include the Moon. In the early morning of 2013 May 10, however, from [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia) [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), the Moon was between the Earth and the rising [Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/). At times, it would be hard for the [uninformed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130513.html) to understand what was happening. In an [annular eclipse](https://c.tadst.com/gfx/1200x630/annular-solar-eclipse.png), the Moon is too far from the [Earth](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/) to block the entire Sun, and at most leaves a [ring of fire](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170301.html) where sunlight pours out around every edge of the Moon. The [featured time-lapse video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJfpqSj7cCs?t=10) also recorded the eclipse through the high refraction of the [Earth's atmosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/) just above the horizon, making the [unusual rising Sun and Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191228.html) appear also [flattened](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230502.html). As the video continues, the Sun continues to rise, while the [Sun and Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150403.html) begin to separate. The [next annular solar eclipse](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/eclipses/2023/oct-14-annular/where-when/) will occur in less than three weeks. On Saturday, October 14, a [ring of fire](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030605.html) will be visible through clear skies from a thin swath crossing both [North and South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas#/media/File:Americas_(orthographic_projection).svg).
