[This asteroid](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00333) has a moon. The [robot spacecraft Galileo](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/galileo/overview/#otp_quick_facts) on route to [Jupiter](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/in-depth/) in 1993 encountered and photographed two [asteroids](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/overview/) during its long interplanetary voyage. The second minor planet it photographed, [243 Ida](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/243-ida/in-depth/), was [unexpectedly](https://i.imgflip.com/eyvnj.jpg) discovered to have a moon. The tiny moon, [Dactyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactyl_(moon)), is only about 1.6 kilometers across and seen as a small dot on the right of the sharpened [featured image](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00069). In contrast, the [potato-shaped](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200401.html) Ida is much larger, measuring about 60 kilometers long and 25 km wide. [Dactyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactyl_(moon)) is the first moon of an asteroid ever discovered -- now many asteroids are [known to have moons](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220927.html). The names Ida and Dactyl are from [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology).
