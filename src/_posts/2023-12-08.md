On December 4, periodic [Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks](https://www.astronomy.com/science/the-devil-comet-is-headed-our-way-and-thats-ok/) shared this [telescopic field of view](https://www.astrobin.com/2qqyw4/B/) with Vega, alpha star of the northern constellation Lyra. Fifth brightest star in planet Earth's night, [Vega](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/vega.html) is some 25 light-years distant while the much fainter comet was about 21 light-minutes away. [In recent months](https://www.space.com/volcanic-devil-comet-eruption-record-earth-close-approach), outbursts have caused dramatic increases in brightness for Pons-Brooks though. Nicknamed the Devil Comet for its hornlike appearance, fans of interstellar spaceflight have also suggested the distorted shape of this comet's large coma looks like the [Millenium Falcon](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/comet-12p-pons-brooks-flares-again/). A Halley-type comet, 12P/Pons-Brooks last visited the inner [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/) in 1954. Its next perihelion passage or closest approach to the Sun will be April 21, 2024. That's just two weeks after the April 8 total solar eclipse path crosses North America. But, highly inclined to the Solar System's ecliptic plane, the orbit of [periodic Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12P/Pons%E2%80%93Brooks) will never cross the orbit of planet Earth.
