Do underground oceans vent through canyons on Saturn's moon Enceladus? Long features dubbed tiger stripes are known to be [spewing ice](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap071013.html) from the moon's icy interior into space, creating a cloud of fine ice particles over the moon's South Pole and creating [Saturn](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/)'s mysterious [E-ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070327.html). Evidence for this has come from the [robot Cassini spacecraft](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/) that orbited [Saturn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn) from 2004 to 2017. [Pictured here](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06254), a high resolution image of [Enceladus](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/moons/enceladus/) is shown from a close flyby. The unusual surface features dubbed [tiger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger) stripes are visible in false-color blue. Why [Enceladus](http://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=Enceladus) is active remains a mystery, as the neighboring moon [Mimas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210531.html), approximately the same size, appears [quite dead](https://youtu.be/4vuW6tQ0218). An [analysis](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/new-organic-compounds-found-in-enceladus-ice-grains/) of [ejected ice grains](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170416.html) has yielded evidence that complex organic molecules exist inside Enceladus. These large carbon-rich [molecules bolster](https://gizmodo.com/the-discovery-of-complex-organic-molecules-on-saturn-s-1827173141) -- but do not prove -- that oceans under Enceladus' surface could [contain life](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/nasa-study-finds-life-sparking-energy-source-and-molecule-at-enceladus/).
