Why is there a huge eye in the sky? [Diamond dust](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-diamond-dust.html). That is an [informal term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_dust) for small [ice crystals](https://old.atoptics.co.uk/halo/platcol.htm) that form in the air and flitter to the ground. Because these crystals are [geometrically shaped](https://old.atoptics.co.uk/halo/platcol.htm), they can together reflect light from the [Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231220.html) or [Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200224.html) to your eyes in a systematic way, causing huge [halos and unusual arcs](https://communitycloudatlas.wordpress.com/2015/04/04/colorful-arcs-in-the-sky/) to appear. And sometimes, together the result can seem like a [giant eye](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201202.html) looking right back at you. In the featured image taken in the [Ore Mountains](https://youtu.be/TcFp5j21HyE) of the [Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic) last week, a bright Moon rising through [ice fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog#Freezing_conditions)\-filled air resulted in many of these [magnificent sky illusions](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Surprised_orange_cat.jpg) to be visible simultaneously. Besides [Moon dogs](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160321.html), [tangent arcs](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180914.html), [halos](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211228.html), and a [parhelic circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parhelic_circle), [light pillars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240304.html) above distant lights are visible on the far left, while [Jupiter](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/) and [Mars](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/) can be found just inside the bottom of the [22-degree halo](https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/en/22-halo.html).
