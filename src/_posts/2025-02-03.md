Some stars explode in slow motion. Rare, massive [Wolf-Rayet stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf-Rayet_star) are so tumultuous and hot that they are slowly disintegrating right before our telescopes. Glowing gas globs each typically over 30 times more massive than [the Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) are being expelled by violent [stellar winds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000318.html). Wolf-Rayet star [WR 124](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WR_124), visible near the [featured image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/14248502065/) center and spanning six [light years](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) across, is thus creating the surrounding nebula known as [M1-67](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985A%26A...145L..13V/abstract). Details of why [this star](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/a-massive-violent-star-blooms) has been slowly blowing itself apart over the past 20,000 years remains a topic of research. [WR 124](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WR_124) lies 15,000 light-years away towards the [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/en/) of the Arrow ([Sagitta](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/sge/)). The fate of any given [Wolf-Rayet star](http://www.universetoday.com/24736/wolf-rayet-star/) likely depends on how massive it is, but many are thought to end their lives with [spectacular](https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad12683c000032000b0e42.jpeg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale) explosions such as [supernovas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aysiMbgml5g) or [gamma-ray bursts](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/gamma-ray-bursts-harvesting-knowledge-from-the-universes-most-powerful-explosions/).
