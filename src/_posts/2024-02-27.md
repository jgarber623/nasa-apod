It's easy to get lost following the intricate, looping, and twisting filaments of [supernova remnant](https://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html) Simeis 147. Also cataloged as Sharpless 2-240, the filamentary nebula goes by the popular nickname the Spaghetti Nebula. [Seen toward](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101220.html) the boundary of the [constellations](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/) of the Bull ([Taurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(constellation))) and the Charioteer ([Auriga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auriga_(constellation))), the impressive gas structure covers nearly 3 [degrees](https://www.1728.org/angsize.htm) on the sky, equivalent to 6 [full moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200925.html)s. That's about 150 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) at the stellar debris cloud's estimated distance of 3,000 light-years. [This composite image](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=7494042507273492) includes data taken through narrow-band filters isolating emission from [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-alpha) (red) and [oxygen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml) (blue) glowing gas. The [supernova](https://youtu.be/wymMn-SmALY) remnant has an estimated age of about 40,000 years, meaning light from this massive stellar explosion first reached the [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) when [woolly mammoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly_mammoth#/media/File:Woolly_mammoth_model_Royal_BC_Museum_in_Victoria.jpg)s roamed free. Besides the expanding remnant, this [cosmic catastrophe](https://mfrost.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/01/11/boston_terror.jpg) [left behind a](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/undefined) [pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar): a spinning [neutron star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170501.html) that is the remnant of the original star's core.
