[Under dark](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130810.html) and mostly moonless night skies, many [denizens of planet Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190815.html) were able to watch this year's Perseid meteor shower. Seen from a grassy hillside from Shiraz, Iran these [Perseid meteors streak](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.278469731548278&type=3) along the northern summer Milky Way before dawn on Sunday, August 13. Frames used to construct the composited image were captured near the [active annual meteor shower's](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/perseids/in-depth/) peak between 02:00 AM and 04:30 AM local time. Not in this night skyscape, the shower's radiant in the heroic constellation Perseus is far above the camera's field of view. But fans of northern summer nights [can still spot](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2308/MSH21080.jpg) a familiar asterism. Formed by bright stars Deneb, Vega, and Altair, the [Summer Triangle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150627.html) spans the luminous band of the Milky Way.
