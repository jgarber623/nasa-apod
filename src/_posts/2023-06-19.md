The center of the Lagoon Nebula is a [whirlwind](https://youtu.be/bjb7QtMEBUg?t=144) of spectacular star formation. Visible near the image center, at least two long funnel-shaped clouds, each roughly half a [light-year](http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html) long, have been formed by extreme [stellar winds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000318.html) and intense [energetic starlight](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves). A tremendously bright nearby star, [Herschel 36](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...445L.153S/abstract), lights the area. Vast walls of [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010813.html) hide and [redden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_reddening) other hot young stars. As energy from these stars pours into the [cool dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010914.html) and gas, large temperature differences in [adjoining regions](https://preview.redd.it/kneuqv5l7n461.jpg?auto=webp&s=2d7a7748018051ddcd76a8abbcb01b9c2dc674fa) can be created generating [shearing winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear) which may cause the [funnels](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/1996/38/462-Image.html). This picture, spanning about 15 light years, combines images taken in four colors by the [orbiting Hubble Space Telescope](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010806.html). The [Lagoon Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181112.html), also known as [M8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon_Nebula), lies about 5000 [light years](https://www.glyphweb.com/esky/concepts/lightyear.html) distant toward the [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/en/) of the Archer ([Sagittarius](https://stardate.org/astro-guide/sagittarius-archer-0)).
