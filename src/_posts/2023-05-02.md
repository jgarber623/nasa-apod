Why are there so many flat rocks on Mars? Some views of plains and hills on [Mars](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/in-depth/) show many rocks that are unusually flat when compared to rocks on Earth. One reason for this is a process that is common to both Mars and Earth: [erosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion). The [carbon-dioxide](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/in-depth/#otp_atmosphere) [wind on Mars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150303.html) can act like sandpaper when it blows around gritty [Martian sand](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190924.html). This sand can create differential erosion, smoothing over [some rocks](https://geology.com/stories/13/rocks-on-mars/), while wearing down the tops of other long-exposed stones. The [featured image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nev-t/52814100597/in/pool-apods/) capturing [several hills](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/27373/n_r000_3783_edr100cylasb2208_autolm1/) covered with flat-topped rocks was taken last month by NASA's [Curiosity Rover](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/) on Mars. This robotic rover has now been rolling across Mars for ten years and has helped [uncover many details](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/science/results/) of the wet and [windy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011017.html) past of Earth's planetary neighbor. After taking this and [other images](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/27294/curiositys-360-degree-view-of-marker-band-valley/), Curiosity carefully navigated stones and slippery sand to climb up [Marker Band Valley](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission-updates/?month=4&year=2023).
