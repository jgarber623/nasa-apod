[Unlike most entries](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-s-messier-catalog) in Charles Messier's famous catalog of deep sky objects, [M24](http://www.messier.seds.org/m/m024.html) is not a bright galaxy, star cluster, or nebula. It's a gap in nearby, obscuring interstellar dust clouds that allows a view of the distant stars in the Sagittarius spiral arm of our Milky Way galaxy. [Direct your gaze](https://oneminuteastronomer.com/4460/small-sagittarius-star-cloud/) through this gap with binoculars or small telescope and you are looking through a window over 300 light-years wide at stars some 10,000 light-years or more from Earth. Sometimes called the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, M24's luminous stars fill [this gorgeous starscape](https://www.flickr.com/photos/136700672@N08/52846209618/in/dateposted-public/). Covering over 3 degrees or the width of 6 full moons in the constellation Sagittarius, the telescopic field of view includes [dark markings](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1919ApJ....49....1B/abstract) B92 and B93 [near center](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100708.html), along with other clouds of dust and glowing nebulae toward the center of the Milky Way.
