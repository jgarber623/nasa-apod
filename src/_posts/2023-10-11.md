What's happening in the lower arm of this spiral galaxy? A [supernova](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/supernovae1.html). Last month, supernova [SN 2023rve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_2023rve) was discovered with [UAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates)'s Al-Khatim Observatory and later [found](https://www.astronomycenter.net/articles/2023/09/10/sn2023rve?l=en) to be consistent with the death explosion of a massive star, possibly leaving behind a [black hole](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes/). Spiral galaxy [NGC 1097](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1097) is a relatively close 45 million [light year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/)s away and visible with a small telescope toward the southern constellation of the Furnace ([Fornax](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/fornax.html)). The galaxy is notable not only for its [picturesque spiral arms](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230508.html), but also for [faint jets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221116.html) consistent with ancient [star streams](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191116.html) left over from a [galactic collision](https://youtu.be/lXy3B2K47Qg) -- possibly with the small galaxy seen between its arms on the lower left. The [featured image](https://azstarman.net/CDK/NGC1097_TL_SN.htm) highlights the new supernova by [blinking](https://www.livescience.com/why-do-we-blink.html) between two exposures taken several months apart. [Finding supernovas](https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/f7/a4/09/f7a40951e62342cf0671e34dcb8dbec2.jpg) in nearby galaxies can be important in determining the [scale](https://apod.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate20.html) and expansion rate of our [entire universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231006.html) -- a topic currently of [unexpected tension](https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2023/09/12/webb-confirms-accuracy-of-universes-expansion-rate-measured-by-hubble-deepens-mystery-of-hubble-constant-tension/) and [much debate](https://apod.nasa.gov/debate/debate.html)[.](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/undefined)
