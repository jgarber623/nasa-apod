Big, beautiful spiral galaxy [NGC 7331](http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n7331.html) is often touted as an analog to our own [Milky Way](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080606.html). About 50 million light-years distant in the northern constellation [Pegasus](http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/peg/index.html), NGC 7331 was recognized early on as a spiral nebula and is actually one of the brighter [galaxies](http://www.seasky.org/cosmic/sky7a07.html) _not_ included in Charles Messier's [famous](https://www.nasa.gov/content/explore-the-night-sky-hubble-s-messier-catalog-bio) 18th century catalog. Since the galaxy's disk [is inclined](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040701.html) to our line-of-sight, long telescopic exposures often result in images that evokes a strong sense of depth. The effect is further enhanced [in this sharp image](https://www.astrobin.com/6xa02f/) by galaxies that lie beyond the gorgeous [island universe](http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March02/Gordon/Gordon2.html). The most prominent background galaxies are about one tenth the [apparent size](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/scale.html) of NGC 7331 and so lie roughly ten times farther away. Their close alignment on the sky with NGC 7331 occurs just by chance. Lingering above the plane of the Milky Way, this striking visual grouping of galaxies is known to some as the [Deer Lick Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7331_Group).
