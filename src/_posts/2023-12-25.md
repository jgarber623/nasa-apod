Single shots like this require planning. The first step is to realize that such an amazing [triple-alignment](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150624.html) actually takes place. The second step is to find the best location to photograph it. But it was the third step: being there at exactly the right time -- and when the sky was clear -- that was the hardest. Five times over six years the photographer tried and found [bad weather](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210613.html). Finally, just ten days ago, the [weather](https://climatekids.nasa.gov/menu/weather-and-climate/) was perfect, and a photographic dream was realized. Taken in [Piemonte](https://youtu.be/oT5LB8wMNHI), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), the cathedral in the foreground is the [Basilica of Superga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Superga), the [mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Viso#/media/File:Monviso_-_panoramica_cresta_da_Ostanetta.jpg) in the middle is [Monviso](https://youtu.be/ViA0MrOkv_Y), and, well, [you know](https://post.bark.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/u4nf59H.png) which moon is in the background. Here, even though the [setting Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200322.html) was captured in a crescent [phase](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5187/), the exposure was long enough for doubly reflected [Earthlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthlight_(astronomy)), called the [da Vinci glow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190926.html), to illuminate the entire top of the [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/).
