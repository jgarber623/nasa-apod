What kind of cloud is this? A type of [arcus cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcus_cloud) called a [roll cloud](https://epod.usra.edu/blog/2011/11/roll-cloud-shelf-cloud.html). These rare long clouds may form near advancing cold fronts. In particular, a downdraft from an advancing storm front can cause moist warm air to [rise](http://neveryetmelted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/LaundryCat.gif), cool below its [dew point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point), and so form [a cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKI2Atj08Xk). When this happens uniformly along an extended front, a [roll cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll_cloud) may form. [Roll clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090824.html) may actually have air circulating along the [long horizontal axis](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060117.html) of the cloud. A [roll cloud](http://www.weatherscapes.com/album.php?cat=clouds&subcat=roll_cloud) is not thought to be able to morph into a [tornado](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050613.html). Unlike a similar [shelf cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080122.html), a roll cloud is completely detached from their parent [cumulonimbus](http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/cld/cldtyp/vrt/cb.rxml) cloud. [Pictured here](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Roll-Cloud-Racine.jpg), a [roll cloud](https://epod.usra.edu/blog/2006/04/lovelock-roll-cloud.html) extends far into the distance as a storm approaches in 2007 in [Racine](https://youtu.be/b2ezPLnsRxk), [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin), USA.
