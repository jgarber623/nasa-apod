[Messier 4 can be found](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-4/) west of bright red-giant star Antares, alpha star of the constellation Scorpius. [M4 itself](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000523.html) is only just visible from dark sky locations, even though the globular cluster of 100,000 stars or so is a mere 5,500 light-years away. Still, its proximity to prying telescopic eyes makes it a prime target for astronomical explorations. Recent studies have included Hubble observations of M4's pulsating cepheid variable stars, cooling white dwarf stars, and ancient, pulsar orbiting [exoplanet PSR B1620-26 b](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/psr-b1620-26-b/). This sharp image was captured with a [small telescope on planet Earth](http://members.pcug.org.au/~stevec/m4_STXL16200_RC14.htm). At M4's estimated distance it spans about 50 light-years across the core of the globular star cluster.
