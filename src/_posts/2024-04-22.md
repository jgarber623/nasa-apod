Yes, but can your volcano do this? To the [surprise](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1128004359/photo/close-up-scottish-fold-cat-head-with-shocking-face-and-wide-open-eyes-frighten-or-surprised.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=HglQ8Nf1PslTuI91T-dfhkln-iEbchjqfhGKCWTbaxg=) of some, [Mt. Etna](https://youtu.be/4ACzGDPnsAM?t=7) emits, on occasion, smoke rings. Technically known as [vortex rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_ring), the walls of the volcano slightly slow the outside of [emitted smoke puffs](https://youtu.be/izlsxgAvL18), causing the inside gas to move faster. A circle of low pressure develops so that the emitted puff of [volcanic gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_gas) and [ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash) loops around in a [ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230814.html), a familiar geometric structure that can be surprisingly stable as it rises. [Smoke ring](https://youtu.be/ckFdAVFgIR8)s are quite rare and need a coincidence of the right [geometry](https://youtu.be/N7d_RWyOv20) of the vent, the right speed of [ejected smoke](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030102.html), and the relative calmness of the outside atmosphere. In the [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/C5h7DueonwE/) taken about two weeks ago from [Gangi](https://youtu.be/VNQVtyNQQ9A), [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), multiple volcanic smoke rings are visible. The scene is shaded by the [red light](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240228.html) of a dawn [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/), while a [crescent Moon](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5187/) is visible in the background.
