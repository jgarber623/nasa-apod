Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas is now headed back to the outer [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/solar-system-facts/). The massive dusty snowball put on [quite a show](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.516503464411569&type=3) during its trip near the Sun, resulting in many impressive pictures from [planet Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html) during October. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBe4x2DorjW/) was taken in mid-October and shows a defining visual feature of the comet -- its impressive [anti-tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tail). The image captures Comet [C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshanâ€“ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_\(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS\)) with [impressively long](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241007.html) [dust](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/*/Cometary+Dust+Tail) and [ion](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/Cometary+Gas+Tail) tails pointing up and away from the Sun, while the [strong anti-tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241015.html) -- composed of more massive dust particles -- trails the comet and points down and (nearly) toward the recently-set [Sun](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/menu/sun/). In the foreground is village of [Tai di Cadore](https://youtu.be/HktA997YN0Y), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), with the tremendous [Dolomite Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomites) in the background. Another comet, [C/2024 S1 (ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_S1_\(ATLAS\)), once a candidate to rival Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas in brightness, [broke up](https://iheartdogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/8522382948_8c6de304a5_z.jpg) last week during its close approach to our Sun.
