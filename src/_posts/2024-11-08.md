[Drifting near](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/decoding-nebulae/) the plane of our Milky Way galaxy these dusty molecular clouds seem to extend a helping hand on a cosmic scale. Part of a [local complex](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Natur.578..237A/abstract) of star-forming interstellar clouds they include LDN 1358, 1357, and 1355 from American astronomer Beverly Lynds' 1962 [Catalog of Dark Nebulae](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1962ApJS....7....1L/abstract). Presenting a [challenging target](https://www.flickr.com/photos/185905403@N06/54113254362/) for astro-imagers, the obscuring dark nebulae are nearly 3,000 light-years away, toward rich starfields in the northern constellation [Cassiopeia](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160318.html). At that distance, this deep, telescopic field of view would span about 80 light-years.
