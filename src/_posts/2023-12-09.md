Near dawn on November 19 [the Pleiades](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230105.html) stood in still dark skies over the French Pyrenees. But just before sunrise a serendipitous moment was captured in this single 3 second exposure; a bright meteor streak appeared to pierce the heart of the galactic star cluster. [From the camera's perspective](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1235572967363002&set=a.677558839831087), star cluster and meteor were poised directly above the mountain top observatory on the [Pic du Midi](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200307.html) de Bigorre. And though astronomers [might consider](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/how-far-are-pleiades-really) the Pleiades to be relatively close by, the [grain of dust vaporizing](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/geminids/) as it plowed through planet Earth's upper atmosphere actually missed the cluster's tight grouping of young stars by about 400 light-years. While [recording a night sky](http://www.echosduciel.fr/) timelapse series, the camera and telephoto lens were fixed to a tripod on the Tour-de-France-[cycled slopes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201002.html) of the [Col du Tourmalet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_du_Tourmalet#Tour_de_France) about 5 kilometers from the Pic du Midi.
