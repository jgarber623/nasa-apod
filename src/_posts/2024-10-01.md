How far can black hole jets extend? A [new record was found](https://www.keckobservatory.org/porphyrion/) just recently with the discovery of a 23-million [light-year](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/) long jet pair from a black hole active billions of years ago. Dubbed [Porphyrion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyrion) for a mythological Greek giant, the impressive jets were created by a type of [black hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240507.html) that does not usually create long jets -- one that is busy creating radiation from infalling gas. The [featured animated video](https://youtu.be/VYjCQ--wEVk) depicts what it might look like to circle around this powerful [black hole](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/) system. [Porphyrion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/science/space/black-hole-m87-energy.html) is shown as a fast stream of [energetic particles](https://www.iar.unlp.edu.ar/biblio/htdocs/artic/contri/1610.pdf), and the bright areas are where these particles are impacting surrounding gas. The discovery was made using data from the [Keck](https://www.keckobservatory.org/) and [Mayall](https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/kitt-peak-national-observatory/nicholas-mayall-4m-telescope/) ([DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/DESI)) optical observatories as well as [LOFAR](https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/en/lofar) and the [Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/gmrt). The existence of [these jets](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/24/science/massive-black-hole-jets-porphyrion/index.html) demonstrates that black holes can affect not only their [home galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030501.html) but [far out](https://wallpapers.com/images/featured/galaxy-cat-kyz6xesjaq5wq8y2.jpg) into the surrounding [universe](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-the-universe/).
