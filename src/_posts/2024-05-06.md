This is how the Sun disappeared from the daytime sky last month. The [featured time-lapse video](https://youtu.be/28gtfSziCgU) was created from stills taken from [Mountain View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_Arkansas), [Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) on 2024 April 8. First, a small sliver of a normally [spotted Sun](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/solar-activity/) went strangely dark. Within a few minutes, much of the background [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) was hidden behind the advancing foreground [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/). Within an hour, the only rays from the Sun [passing the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230917.html) appeared like a [diamond ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240420.html). During totality, most of the [surrounding sky went dark](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240331.html), making the bright [pink prominences](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240414.html) around the Sun's edge stand out, and making the [amazing corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230516.html) appear to spread into the surrounding sky. The central view of the [corona](https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/origin-corona's-light) shows an accumulation of frames taken during complete totality. As the video ends, just a few minutes later, [another diamond ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060330.html) appeared -- this time on the [other side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon). Within the next hour, the sky [returned to normal](https://static9.depositphotos.com/1062590/1212/i/450/depositphotos_12126489-Funny-ginger-cat-wearing-sunglasses-and-relaxing-on-a-coach.jpg).
