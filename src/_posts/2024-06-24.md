What if we could see back to the beginning of the universe? We could see galaxies forming. But what did [galaxies look like](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210802.html) back then? These questions took a step forward recently with the [release of the analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18485) of a [James Webb Space Telescope](https://webb.nasa.gov/content/about/index.html) (JWST) image that included the most distant object yet discovered. Most [galaxies formed](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/galaxies/evolution/) at about 3 billion years after the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang), but some formed earlier. [Pictured](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/early-highlights/nasas-james-webb-space-telescope-finds-most-distant-known-galaxy) in the inset box is [JADES](https://jades-survey.github.io/)\-[GS-z14-0](https://esawebb.org/images/jades4/), a faint smudge of [a galaxy that formed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230531.html) only 300 million years after the [universe started](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231231.html). In technical terms, this galaxy lies at the record [redshift](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130408.html) of z=14.32, and so existed when the [universe](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/featured_science/tenyear/age.html) was only one fiftieth of the its present age. [Practically all](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQCn05AuCb0JVqZCnh5FzGXDqXOtri0W2cwEw&s) of the objects in the [featured photograph](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01HZ083EXXCJNE64ERAH2ER2FM) are galaxies.
