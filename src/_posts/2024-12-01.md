What color is the universe? More precisely, if the [entire sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap020310.html) were smeared out, what color would the final mix be? This whimsical [question](http://sten.astronomycafe.net/faqs/) came up when trying to determine what stars are commonplace in nearby galaxies. The answer, depicted here, is a [conditionally perceived shade](https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/how-humans-see-in-color) of [beige](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beige). In computer parlance: #[FFF8E7](https://www.color-hex.com/color/fff8e7). To determine this, astronomers computationally averaged the light emitted by one of the larger samples of [galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap071007.html) analyzed: the 200,000 [galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010904.html) of the [2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2dF_Galaxy_Redshift_Survey). The resulting [cosmic spectrum](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...569..582B/abstract) has some emission in all parts of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro), but a single perceived composite color. [This color](https://www.curiositybox.com/blogs/inqs-corner/cosmic-latte-the-average-color-of-the-universe) has become much less blue over [the past](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180508.html) 10 billion years, indicating that redder stars are becoming [more prevalent](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fprm50mltnj4d1.jpeg). In a [contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte#Naming_the_color) to better name the color, notable entries included skyvory, univeige, and the winner: [cosmic latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte).
