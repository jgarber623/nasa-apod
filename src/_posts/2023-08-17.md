Sprawling emission nebulae IC 1396 and Sh2-129 mix glowing interstellar gas and dark dust clouds in this nearly [12 degree wide field](https://www.astrobin.com/g6612z/) of view toward the northern constellation [Cepheus the King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus_(constellation)). Energized by its central star [IC 1396](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120805.html) (left), is hundreds of light-years across and some 3,000 light-years distant. The nebula's intriguing dark shapes include a winding dark cloud popularly known as the [Elephant's Trunk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190816.html) below and right of center. Tens of light-years long, it holds the raw material for star formation and is known to hide [protostars](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/multi-wavelength-views-of-protostars-in-ic-1396) within. Located a similar distance from planet Earth, the bright knots and swept back ridges of emission of Sh2-129 on the right suggest its popular name, the [Flying Bat Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201007.html). Within the Flying Bat, the most recently recognized addition to this royal cosmic zoo is the faint bluish emission from Ou4, the [Giant Squid Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140718.html). Near the lower right edge of the frame, the suggestive dark marking on the sky cataloged as Barnard 150 is also known as the [dark Seahorse Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230420.html).
