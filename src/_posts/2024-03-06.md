What kind of celestial object is this? A relatively normal galaxy -- but seen from its edge. Many disk galaxies are actually just as thin as NGC 5866, the Spindle galaxy, [pictured here](https://www.astrobin.com/xhlow5/), but are not [seen edge-on](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010510.html) from our vantage point. A perhaps more familiar galaxy seen edge-on is our own [Milky Way galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/). Also cataloged as M102, the [Spindle galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_5866) has numerous and complex dust lanes appearing dark and red, while many of the bright stars in the disk give it a more blue underlying hue. The blue disk of young [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/) can be seen in this [Hubble](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/) image extending past the [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990919.html) in the extremely [thin galactic plane](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180725.html). There is evidence that the [Spindle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_(textiles)#/media/File:Drop_spindles.jpg) galaxy has cannibalized smaller galaxies over the past billion years or so, including [multiple streams](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180206.html) of faint stars, dark dust that extends away from the main galactic plane, and a [surrounding group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_5866_Group) of galaxies (not shown). In general, many [disk galaxies become thin](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230531.html) because the gas that [forms them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution) collides with itself as it rotates about the gravitational center. The [Spindle galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160309.html) lies about 50 million [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) distant toward the constellation of the Dragon ([Draco](http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/draco.htm)).
