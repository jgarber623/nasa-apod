Now this was a view with a thrill. From [Mount Tschirgant](https://youtu.be/Gm8sOBqSyQw) in the [Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps), you can see not only nearby towns and distant [Tyrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrol)ean peaks, but also, weather permitting, stars, nebulas, and the band of the [Milky Way Galaxy](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/). What made the [arduous climb](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/544319716/photo/climbing-to-the-top.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=B4ovKO6e7SnU_o2c3RAJOI3UpbFzqAr4zBte1VVMreA=) worthwhile this night, though, was another peak -- the peak of the 2018 [Perseids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids) [Meteor](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180908.html) [Shower](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170801.html). As hoped, dispersing clouds allowed a picturesque sky-gazing session that included [many faint](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220818.html) [meteors](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/meteor-shower/), all while a carefully positioned camera took a series of exposures. Suddenly, a thrilling meteor -- [bright](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171225.html) and [colorful](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181219.html) -- slashed down right next to the nearly [vertical band of the Milky Way](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180911.html). As luck would have it, the camera caught it too. Therefore, a new image in the series was quickly taken with one of the [sky-gazers](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040808.html) posing on the nearby peak. Later, all of the images were [digitally combined](https://www.facebook.com/DrNicholasRoemmeltPhotography/photos/a.230469333765914/1468508936628608/?type=3&theater).
