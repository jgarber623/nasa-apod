Did you see last night's aurora? This question was relevant around much of the world a few days ago because a powerful auroral storm became [visible unusually far](https://spaceweathergallery2.com/index.php?title=aurora) from the Earth's poles. The cause was a giant [X-class solar flare on Tuesday](https://blogs.nasa.gov/solarcycle25/2024/10/09/sun-releases-strong-solar-flare-17/) that launched energetic [electrons](https://www.aps.org/archives/publications/apsnews/200010/history.cfm) and protons into the [Solar System](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240713.html), connecting to the Earth via our planet's [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field#/media/File:Geodynamo_Between_Reversals.gif). A [red glow](https://www.theaurorazone.com/about-the-aurora/the-science-of-the-northern-lights/the-northern-lights-colours/) of these particles striking [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen) atoms high in [Earth's atmosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-atmosphere/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/) pervades the frame, while [vertical streaks](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/75/47/89/75478977b544313ab56eda755b9025e7.jpg) dance. The [featured video](https://www.instagram.com/p/DA_ulQuoyvO/) shows a one-hour timelapse as seen from [Cortina d'Ampezzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortina_d%27Ampezzo) over [Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps) Mountain [peaks](https://youtu.be/iuM3h3vY6eE?t=12) in northern [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). Stars from our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) dot the background while streaks from airplanes and satellites punctuate the foreground. The [high recent activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum) of [our Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240615.html) is likely to continue to produce [picturesque auroras](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240612.html) over Earth during the next year or so.
