Colorful and bright, this streaking fireball meteor was captured in a single exposure taken at [Purple Mountain (Tsuchinshan)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Mountain_Observatory) Observatoryâ€™s Xuyi Station in 2020, during planet Earth's annual Perseid meteor shower. The dome in the foreground houses the China Near Earth Object Survey Telescope (CNEOST), the largest multi-purpose Schmidt telescope in China. Located in Xuyi County, Jiangsu Province, the station began its operation as an extension of China's Purple Mountain Observatory in 2006. [Darling of planet Earth's night skies](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=APOD.Sky&set=a.516503464411569) in 2024, the bright comet designated [Tsuchinshan-ATLAS (C/2023 A3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_\(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS\)) was discovered in images taken there on 2023 January 9. The discovery is jointly credited to NASA's [ATLAS robotic survey telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/nasa-asteroid-tracking-system-now-capable-of-full-sky-search/) at Sutherland Observatory, South Africa. Other comet discoveries associated with the historic Purple Mountain Observatory and bearing the observatory's transliterated Mandarin name include periodic comets 60/P Tsuchinshan and 62/P Tsuchinshan.
