What created this unusual hole in Mars? Actually, there are numerous holes pictured in this [Swiss cheese-like landscape](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010327.html), with all-but-one of them showing a dusty, dark, Martian terrain beneath [evaporating, light, carbon dioxide ice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WABthlGTy74). The most [unusual hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200301.html) is on the upper right, spans about 100 meters, and seems to punch through to a lower level. Why [this hole](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/pia21636/a-south-polar-pit-or-an-impact-crater) exists and why it is surrounded by a circular crater remains a topic of [speculation](http://www.lifeinthedoglane.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/puppy-head-tilt.jpg), although a leading hypothesis is that it was created by a meteor impact. [Holes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070528.html) such as [this](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070928.html) are of particular interest because they might be portals to lower levels that extend into expansive [underground caves](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/project/lavamatic/). If so, these naturally occurring tunnels are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to [contain Martian life](https://phys.org/news/2024-11-volcanic-caves-advances-life-mars.html). These pits are therefore also prime targets for [possible future spacecraft, robots](https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/programs/mars-exploration/), and even [human interplanetary explorers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_Chronicles).
