The bright part of the plume is illuminated by the Sun and casts a long and dark shadow corridor across the image. The shadow appears to end on a Full Moon.

Why would the shadow of a [rocket's launch plume](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/1221/smoke-plume) point toward the Moon? In early 2001 during a launch of the [space shuttle](https://www.nasa.gov/space-shuttle/) [Atlantis](https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/explore-attractions/shuttle-a-ship-like-no-other/featured-attraction/space-shuttle-atlantis), the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/), [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html), [Moon](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5187/), and rocket were all properly aligned for [this photogenic coincidence](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/1221/smoke-plume). First, for the [space shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle)'s plume to cast a long shadow, the time of day must be either near [sunrise](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170705.html) or [sunset](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231025.html). Only then will the [shadow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161026.html) be its longest and extend all the way to the [horizon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171205.html). Finally, during a [Full Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000113.html), the [Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010129.html) and [Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180318.html) are on opposite sides of the sky. Just after [sunset](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060723.html), for example, the Sun is slightly below the [horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon), and, in the other direction, the Moon is slightly above the [horizon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000320.html). Therefore, as [Atlantis](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap950812.html) blasted off, just after [sunset](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220320.html), its shadow projected away from the Sun toward the [opposite horizon](https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article27932447.ece/ALTERNATES/n615/0_PAY-GREAT-DANE-OPTICAL-ILLUSION.jpg), where the [Full Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html) happened to be.
