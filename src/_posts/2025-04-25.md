[Main belt asteroid](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/) [52246 Donaldjohanson](https://minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?utf8=%E2%9C%93&object_id=donaldjohanson) is about 8 kilometers long and 3.5 kilometers across. [On April 20, this sharp close-up](https://science.nasa.gov/image-article/nasas-lucy-spacecraft-images-asteroid-donaldjohanson/) of the asteroid was captured at a distance of about 1100 kilometers by the Lucy spacecraft's long range camera during its second asteroid encounter. [Named after](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52246_Donaldjohanson) American paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, discoverer of the Lucy hominid fossil, the elongated asteroid was likely formed about 150 million years ago from a gentle collision of two smaller bodies creating its characteristic contact binary shape. Launched in October of 2021, [the Lucy spacecraft](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lucy/spacecraft/) will continue its travels through the main asteroid belt in 2025, but is on its way to explore Jupiter's swarm of [Trojan asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_trojan). Lucy is expected to encounter its first Trojan asteroid target, [3548 Eurybates](https://minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?utf8=%E2%9C%93&object_id=eurybates), in August 2027.
