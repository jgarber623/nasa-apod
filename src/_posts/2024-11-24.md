What lies at the center of our galaxy? In [Jules Verne](http://www.julesverne.ca/jvlinks.html)'s science fiction classic, [A Journey to the Center of the Earth](http://jv.gilead.org.il/wolcott/CE-allc/), Professor Liedenbrock and his fellow explorers encounter many strange and exciting wonders. Astronomers already know of some of the bizarre objects that exist at our [Galactic Center](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100831.html), including [vast cosmic dust clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120106.html), [bright star clusters](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap071219.html), [swirling rings of gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230403.html), and even a [supermassive black hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240401.html). Much of the [Galactic Center](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220202.html) is [shielded from our view](https://files.ctctcdn.com/3a7f39ae001/aedd7697-f09f-4b3a-8f7b-256d0a0389bc.jpg) in visible light by the intervening dust and gas, but it can be explored using [other forms](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030712.html) of [electromagnetic radiation](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro). The [featured video](http://www.eso.org/public/videos/eso1151d/) is actually a digital zoom into the [Milky Way's center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgr_A*) which starts by utilizing visible light images from the [Digitized Sky Survey](http://archive.eso.org/dss/dss). As [the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNHexFdacK0) proceeds, the light shown shifts to dust-penetrating [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) and highlights gas clouds that were recently [discovered in 2013](http://www.universetoday.com/95982/gas-cloud-will-collide-with-our-galaxys-black-hole-in-2013/) to be falling toward the central black hole.
