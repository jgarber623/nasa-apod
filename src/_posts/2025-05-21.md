Typically, the International Space Station is visible only at night. Slowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/) (ISS) can be seen as a [bright spot](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200528.html) about once a month from many locations. [The ISS](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/faq.cfm) is then visible only just after sunset or just before sunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- once the [ISS](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161105.html) enters the [Earth's shadow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080820.html), it will drop [out of sight](https://www.reddit.com/r/FindTheSniper/comments/1chffk6/find_the_cat/#lightbox). The only occasion when the [ISS is visible during the day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160513.html) is when it [passes right in front of the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190715.html). Then, it passes so quickly that only cameras taking short exposures can visually freeze the [ISS's silhouette](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150912.html) onto the background [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/). The [featured picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/DIrW8Vuoh-f/) did exactly that -- it is actually a series of images taken a month ago from [Sant Feliu de Buixalleu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant_Feliu_de_Buixalleu), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) with perfect timing. [This image series](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/IssTransit_Sanz.mp4) was later combined with a separate image highlighting the texture of the active Sun which included several [Sun's prominences](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180618.html) around the edge.
