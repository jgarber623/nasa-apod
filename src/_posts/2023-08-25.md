[Ringed planet Saturn](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/) will be at its 2023 opposition, opposite the Sun in Earth's skies, on August 27. While that puts the sixth planet from the Sun at its [brightest and well-placed](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/saturn-at-opposition-closest-brightest-best/) for viewing, its beautiful ring system isn't visible to the unaided eye. Still, this sequence of telescopic images taken a year apart over the last six years follows both Saturn and rings as seen from inner planet Earth. The gas giant's [ring plane tilts](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210919.html) from most open in 2018 to approaching edge-on in 2023 (top to bottom). That's summer to nearly the autumn [equinox for Saturn's](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap091110.html) northern hemisphere. In the sharp planetary portraits, Saturn's northern [hexagon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230618.html) and a large [storm](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110119.html) system are clearly visible in 2018. In 2023, [ice moon Tethys](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170205.html) is transiting, casting its shadow across southern hemisphere cloud bands, while Saturn's cold blue south pole is emerging from almost a decade of winter darkness.
