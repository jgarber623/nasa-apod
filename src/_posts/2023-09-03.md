Periodic comet [73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3](http://cometography.com/pcomets/073p.html) has broken up at least twice. A [cosmic souffle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050915.html) of ice and dust left over from the early solar system, this comet was first [seen to split](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2016/news-2016-35.html) into several large pieces during the close-in part of its orbit in 1995. However, [in the 2006 passage](https://skyandtelescope.org/press-releases/comet-schwassmann-wachmann-3-at-its-best/), it disintegrated into dozens of fragments that stretched several degrees across the sky. Since [comets](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/overview/) are relatively fragile, stresses from heat, gravity and outgassing, for example, could be responsible for their tendency [to break up](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000811.html) in such a spectacular fashion when they near the [hot Sun](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d1/bb/1b/d1bb1bcb8e244356d0bd053e134344a3.jpg). The Hubble Space Telescope [recorded, in 2006, the featured sharp view](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/videos/2006/18/527-Video.html) of prolific [Fragment B](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060426.html), itself trailing a multitude of smaller pieces, each with its own cometary coma and tail. The picture spans over 3,000 kilometers at the comet's distance of 32 million kilometers from [planet Earth](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-earth/).
