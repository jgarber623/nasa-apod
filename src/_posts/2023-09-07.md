The 16th century Portuguese navigator [Ferdinand Magellan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan) and his crew had plenty of time to study the southern sky during the [first circumnavigation](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1519magellan.html) of planet Earth. As a result, two fuzzy cloud-like objects easily visible to southern hemisphere skygazers are known as the [Clouds of Magellan](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060809.html), now understood to be satellite galaxies of our much larger, spiral Milky Way galaxy. About 160,000 light-years distant in the constellation Dorado, the [Large Magellanic Cloud](http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/lmc.html) is seen in this [sharp galaxy portrait](https://www.cwastrophotography.com/the-large-magellanic-cloud-lmc). Spanning about 15,000 light-years or so, it is the most massive of the Milky Way's [satellite galaxies](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/sattelit.html) and is the home of the [closest supernova](http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/04/) in modern times, [SN 1987A](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170305.html). The prominent patch above center is 30 Doradus, also known as the magnificent [Tarantula Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090916.html), a giant star-forming region about 1,000 light-years across.
