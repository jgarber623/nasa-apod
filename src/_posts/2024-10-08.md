Can you find the Sun? OK, but can you explain why thereâ€™s a big dark spot in the center? The spot is [the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240915.html), and the impressive alignment shown, where the [Moon lines up inside the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220509.html), is called an [annular solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/types/). Such an eclipse occurred [just last week](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241003.html) and was visible from a [thin swath](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/oct-2-annular-eclipse/) mostly in [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/)'s southern hemisphere. The featured image was captured from [Patagonia](https://youtu.be/eOUXXzj19X0), [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile). When the Moon is [significantly closer](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FX8moh5X0AENK7J.jpg) to the Earth and it aligns with the Sun, a [total solar eclipse](https://youtu.be/vIZyuXl-91U) is then visible from parts of the Earth. [Annular eclipses](https://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=annular) are slightly more common than total eclipses, but as [the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190717.html) moves slowly away from the [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210905.html), before a [billion more years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Earth), the Moon's orbit will [no longer](https://youtu.be/W7mVQ3kRPv8) bring it close enough for a [total solar eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170820.html) to be seen from anywhere on [Earth](https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/ExplorePhotos/).
