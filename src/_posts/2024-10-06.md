Comet McNaught, the Great Comet of 2007, grew a spectacularly long and filamentary tail. The magnificent [tail](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/en/anatomy-of-a-comet.en.jpg) spread across the sky and was visible for several days to Southern Hemisphere observers just after sunset. The [amazing ion tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070117.html) showed its greatest extent on long-duration, wide-angle camera exposures. During some times, [just the tail](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwhy-does-my-chair-have-a-tail-v0-qb21j8tqqm9d1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D4939c7f7cdca268e0d7ee51860e129ca09b27648) itself [was visible](http://spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_mcnaught_page11.htm) just above the horizon for many northern observers as well. [Comet C/2006 P1 (McNaught)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_McNaught), estimated to have attained a [peak brightness](https://web.archive.org/web/20111228014918/http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/brightest.html) of [magnitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude) -5 (minus five), was caught by the [comet's discoverer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._McNaught) in the featured image just after sunset in January 2007 from [Siding Spring Observatory](https://youtu.be/A-85ZRf6z3U) in [Australia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia). Comet McNaught, the brightest [comet](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/facts/) in decades, then [faded](http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/C2006P1_eph.html) as it moved further into southern skies and away from the [Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230222.html) and [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060927.html). Over the next month, [Comet Tsuchinshanâ€“ATLAS](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240925.html), a candidate for the Great Comet of 2024, should display its most [spectacular tails](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210308.html) visible from the [Earth](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/).
