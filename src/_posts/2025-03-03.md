There's a new lander on the Moon. Yesterday [Firefly Aerospace](https://fireflyspace.com/)'s [Blue Ghost](https://fireflyspace.com/missions/blue-ghost-mission-1/) executed the first-ever successful commercial lunar landing. During its planned 60-day mission, [Blue Ghost](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250301.html) will deploy several [NASA-commissioned](https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/missions/2025/03/02/nasa-science-touches-down-on-moon-aboard-firefly-aerospace-lander/) scientific instruments, including [PlanetVac](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/clps/nasa-lander-to-test-vacuum-cleaner-on-moon-for-sample-collection/) which captures [lunar dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221214.html) after creating a small whirlwind of gas. [Blue Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ghost_Mission_1) will also host the [telescope LEXI](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasas-lexi-will-provide-x-ray-vision-of-earths-magnetosphere/) that captures X-ray images of the [Earth's magnetosphere](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4141). [LEXI](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38756703/) data should enable a [better understanding](https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/dog-using-computer-nerd-glasses-laptop-keyboard_67473-1841.jpg) of how Earth's magnetic field protects the Earth from the [Sun's wind](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000318.html) and [flare](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180902.html)s. [Pictured](https://www.flickr.com/photos/fireflyspace/54359866846/in/datetaken/), the shadow of the [Blue Ghost lander](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=BLUEGHOST) is visible on the cratered [lunar surface](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031109.html), while the glowing orb of the [planet Earth hovers](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220227.html) just over the horizon. Goals for [future robotic Blue Ghost landers](https://fireflyspace.com/missions/blue-ghost-mission-2/) include supporting lunar astronauts in NASA's [Artemis program](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/), with [Artemis III](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-iii/) currently scheduled to land humans back on the Moon in 2027.
