[In 1716](http://messier.seds.org/xtra/similar/halley_pt.html), English astronomer [Edmond Halley](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/halley_edmond.shtml) noted, "This is but a little Patch, but it shows itself to the naked Eye, when the Sky is serene and the Moon absent." [Of course, M13](http://messier.seds.org/m/m013.html) is now less modestly recognized as the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules, one of the brightest [globular star clusters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster) in the northern sky. [Sharp telescopic views like this one](https://www.astrobin.com/mxfret/C/) reveal the spectacular cluster's [hundreds of thousands of stars.](https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/gobs-of-globs-guide-to-16-spring-globular-clusters/) At a distance of 25,000 light-years, the [cluster stars crowd](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2008/news-2008-40.html) into a region 150 light-years in diameter. [Approaching](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031213.html) the cluster core, upwards of 100 stars could be contained in a cube just 3 light-years on a side. For comparison, the [closest star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160825.html) to the Sun is over 4 light-years away. The remarkable range of brightness recorded in this image follows stars into the dense cluster core.
