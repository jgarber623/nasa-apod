If you could stand on [Venus](https://science.nasa.gov/venus/) -- what would you see? Pictured is the view from Venera 14, a robotic [Soviet lander](http://mentallandscape.com/V_Venus.htm) which parachuted and [air-brake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_brake_\(aeronautics\))d down through the thick Venusian atmosphere in March of 1982. The desolate landscape it saw included flat rocks, vast empty terrain, and a featureless sky above [Phoebe Regio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_Regio) near [Venus' equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera#/media/File:VenusLanderTopo.jpg). On the lower left is the spacecraft's [penetrometer](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1981-110D-10) used to make scientific measurements, while the light piece on the right is part of an ejected lens-cap. Enduring [temperatures](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/solar-system-temperatures/) near 450 degrees [Celsius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius) and [pressure](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/venus-air-pressure)s 75 times that on Earth, the hardened [Venera spacecraft](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/venera.html) lasted only about an hour. Although data from [Venera 14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_14) was beamed across the inner [Solar System](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/orrery/#/home) over 40 years ago, digital processing and merging of [Venera's unusual images](http://mentallandscape.com/V_DigitalImages.htm) continues even today. Recent analyses of [infrared measurements](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200114.html) taken by [ESA](http://www.esa.int/)'s orbiting [Venus Express](http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Venus_Express) spacecraft indicate that active [volcanoes may currently exist](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201027.html) on Venus.
