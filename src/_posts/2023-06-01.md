Massive stars in our Milky Way Galaxy live spectacular lives. Collapsing from vast cosmic clouds, their nuclear furnaces ignite and create heavy elements in their cores. After a few million years, the [enriched material](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190801.html) is blasted back into interstellar space where star formation can begin anew. The expanding debris cloud known as Cassiopeia A is an example of this final phase of the stellar life cycle. Light from the explosion which created this supernova remnant would have been first [seen in planet Earth's sky](https://spider.seds.org/spider/Vars/casA.html) about 350 years ago, although it took that light about 11,000 years to reach us. [This false-color image, composed of X-ray and optical image data](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/the-latest-look-at-first-light-from-chandra.html) from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope, shows the still hot filaments and knots in the remnant. It spans about 30 light-years at the estimated distance of Cassiopeia A. High-energy X-ray emission from specific elements has been color coded, silicon in red, sulfur in yellow, calcium in green and iron in purple, to help [astronomers explore](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.7316) the recycling of our galaxy's [star stuff](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171119.html). Still expanding, the outer blast wave is seen in blue hues. [The bright speck](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170501.html) near the center is a neutron star, the incredibly dense, collapsed remains of the massive stellar core.
