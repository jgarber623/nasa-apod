Light pollution is usually not a problem [in Qeqertaq](https://denniina.com/gallery/23-24). In western Greenland the remote coastal village boasted a population of 114 in 2020. Lights still shine in its dark skies though. [During planet Earth's](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/nasa-sounding-rocket-launches-into-alaskan-aurora/) recent intense geomagnetic storm, on November 6 these beautiful curtains of aurora borealis fell [over the arctic realm](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzVRGZlMyu_/). On the eve of the coming weeks of [polar night](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/polar-night.html) at 70 degrees north latitude, the inspiring display of northern lights is reflected in the waters of Disko Bay. In this view from the isolated settlement a lone iceberg is illuminated by shore lights as it drifts [across the icy sea](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150801/thinning-of-the-northeast-greenland-ice-stream).
