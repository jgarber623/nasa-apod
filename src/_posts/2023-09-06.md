They may look like modern mechanical dinosaurs, but they are enormous swiveling eyes that watch the sky. The [High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Observatory](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/pages/about/telescopes/) is composed of four 12-meter reflecting-mirror telescopes surrounding a [larger telescope](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120727.html) housing a 28-meter mirror. They are designed to detect strange flickers of blue light -- [Cherenkov radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation) --emitted when [charged particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle) move slightly faster than the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light) in air. This light is emitted when a [gamma ray](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/12_gammarays) from a distant source strikes a molecule in [Earth's atmosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/) and starts a [charged-particle shower](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060814.html). [H.E.S.S.](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/pages/about/) is sensitive to some of the highest energy photons ([TeV](https://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2013/11/27/how-often-does-the-sun-emit-1-tev-photons)) crossing the universe. Operating since 2003 in [Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia), H.E.S.S. has searched for [dark matter](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/what-is-dark-matter.html) and has [discovered over 50 sources](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...612A...1H/abstract) emitting high energy radiation including [supernova remnants](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230601.html) and the [centers of galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180729.html) that contain supermassive [black holes](https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html). Pictured in June, [H.E.S.S. telescopes](https://youtu.be/0u9lr1RXpsE) swivel and stare in [time-lapse sequences](https://youtu.be/xjMtlL1dCeA) shot in front of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180427.html) and the [Magellanic Clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160725.html) -- as the occasional Earth-orbiting satellite zips by.
