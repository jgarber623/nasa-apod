Will the spider ever catch the fly? Not if both are large emission nebulas toward the constellation of the Charioteer ([Auriga](http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/aur/index.html)). The [spider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spider_and_the_Fly_\(poem\)#Text)\-shaped gas cloud in the image center is actually an emission nebula labelled [IC 417](https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-ic417/), while the smaller fly-shaped cloud on the left is dubbed [NGC 1931](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1931) and is both an emission nebula and a reflection nebula. About 10,000 [light-years](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/) distant, both nebulas harbor young star clusters. For scale, the more compact [NGC 1931](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151201.html) (Fly) is about 10 light-years across. The [featured](https://www.flickr.com/photos/158660766@N05/54291858602/in/pool-apods/) deep [image](https://www.astrobin.com/5f29e1/), captured over 20 hours during late January in [Berkshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire) [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), also shows more diffuse and red-glowing interstellar gas and dust.
