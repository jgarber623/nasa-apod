A cosmic dust grain plowing through the upper atmosphere much faster than [a falling leaf](https://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/LasLea.shtml) created this brilliant [meteor streak](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/). In a serendipitous moment, the sublime night sky view was captured from the resort island of Capri, in the Bay of Naples, on the evening of February 8. Looking across the bay, the camera faces northeast toward the lights of Naples and surrounding cities. Pointing toward the horizon, the [meteor streak](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231209.html) by chance ends above the silhouette of Mount Vesuvius. One of planet Earth's most famous volcanos, an eruption of [Mount Vesuvius](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/wright-vesuvius-in-eruption-with-a-view-over-the-islands-in-the-bay-of-naples-t05846) destroyed the city of Pompeii [in 79 AD](https://igppweb.ucsd.edu/~gabi/sio15/lectures/volcanoes/vesuvius.html).
