To some, this nebula looks like the head of a [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish#/media/File:Dunkleosteus_profile.jpg). However, [this colorful cosmic portrait](https://www.fast-aio.net/fishheadhso) really features [glowing gas and obscuring dust](http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html) clouds in IC 1795, a star forming region in the northern [constellation Cassiopeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation)). The nebula's colors were created by adopting the [Hubble color palette](http://bf-astro.com/hubblep.htm) for mapping narrowband emissions from oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur atoms to blue, green and red colors, and further blending the data with images of the region recorded through broadband filters. Not far on the sky from the famous [Double Star Cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap091204.html) in Perseus, IC 1795 is itself located next to IC 1805, the [Heart Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090214.html), as part of a [complex of star forming regions](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/nebulae/ic1805.html) that lie at the edge of a large molecular cloud. Located just over 6,000 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) away, the larger star forming complex sprawls along the Perseus spiral arm of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080606.html). At that distance, IC 1795 would [span](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/175194979/photo/big-stretch.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=1DMdAkJMllfbCuwlN0OdD1vWbsz-kdD-PloadnaPDwY=) about 70 light-years across.
