When [Vulcan](https://mythopedia.com/topics/vulcan), the [Roman god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_mythology) of fire, swings his blacksmith's hammer, the sky is lit on [fire](https://youtu.be/Q2FzZSBD5LE?t=95). A recent eruption of [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile)'s [Villarrica volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villarrica_\(volcano\)) shows the delicate interplay between this fire -- actually glowing steam and [ash](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190512.html) from [melted rock](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120402.html) -- and the light from distant stars in our [Milky Way galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) and the [Magellanic Clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230211.html) galaxies. In the featured timelapse video, the [Earth rotates](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200701.html) under the stars as [Villarrica erupts](https://youtu.be/mDJGA-YiY14). With about [1350 volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_volcano), our [planet Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) rivals [Jupiter's moon Io](https://www.space.com/jupiter-moon-io-volcanoes-map) as the most [geologically active](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia25888-io-in-color-and-infrared) place in the [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/solar-system-facts/). While both have magnificent beauty, the reasons for the existence of volcanoes on both worlds are different. Earth's volcanoes typically occur between slowly shifting [outer shell plates](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/volcanoes/plate-tectonics-and-volcanoes.htm), while [Io](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/moons/io/)'s volcanoes are caused by [gravitational flexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_heating) resulting from [Jupiter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170523.html)'s tidal gravitational [pull](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQRKoaqHZb45w9bZmBUWhx16kYBu5JmsPTIVw&s).
