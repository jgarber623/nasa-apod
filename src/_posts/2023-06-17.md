Recorded during 2017, timelapse sequences from the International Space Station are compiled in this [serene video of planet Earth at Night](https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/BeyondThePhotography/CrewEarthObservationsVideos/). Fans of low Earth orbit can start by enjoying the view as green and red aurora borealis [slather up the sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210114.html). The night scene tracks from northwest to southeast across North America, toward the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida coast. A second sequence follows European city lights, crosses the Mediterranean Sea, and passes over a bright Nile river in northern Africa. Seen from the orbital outpost, erratic flashes of lightning appear in thunder storms below and stars rise above the planet's curved horizon through a faint [atmospheric airglow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210418.html). Of course, from home you can always check out the [vital signs of Planet Earth Now.](https://climate.nasa.gov/earth-now/#/vitalsign?vitalsign=satellites&altid=0&animating=f&start=&end=)
