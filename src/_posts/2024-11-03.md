What's that black spot on Jupiter? No one is sure. During one pass of NASA's [Juno](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/juno/) over [Jupiter](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/), the robotic spacecraft imaged an [usually dark cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171008.html) feature informally dubbed [the Abyss](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia22948-jupiter-abyss/). Surrounding cloud patterns show [the Abyss](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22948) to be at the center of [a vortex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XMd8AnEJBA). Since dark features on [Jupiter's atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter) tend to run deeper than light features, the Abyss may really be the [deep hole](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/g2919/7-of-the-deepest-manmade-holes/) that it appears -- but without more evidence that remains conjecture. The [Abyss](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F1h6ozh8wsu501.jpg) is surrounded by a complex of [meandering clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181121.html) and other [swirling](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180521.html) [storm systems](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170228.html), some of which are topped by light colored, high-altitude clouds. The [featured image](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing?id=6906) was captured in 2019 while [Juno passed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190205.html) only about 15,000 kilometers above [Jupiter's cloud tops](https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceporn/comments/10b94mk/jupiters_abyss_the_dark_center_of_a_massive/). The [next close pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_\(spacecraft\)#Timeline) of Juno near Jupiter will be in about three weeks.
