That's [no moon](https://youtu.be/i7eqjiRRIqg). On the ground, that's the [Lars Homestead](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lars-homestead) in [Tunisia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia). And that's not just any galaxy. That's the central band of our own [Milky Way galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230620.html). Last, that's not just any meteor. It is a bright [fireball](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap081125.html) likely from last year's [Perseids meteor shower](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/perseids/). The [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/jzupqh/) composite combines consecutive exposures taken by the same camera from the same location. [This year's Perseids](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-perseid-meteor-shower/) peak during the coming weekend is [expected to show](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/whats-up-august-2024-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/) the most meteors after the [first quarter moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/lunar-phases-and-eclipses/) sets, near midnight. To [best experience](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/how-to-see-the-best-meteor-showers-of-the-year-tools-tips-and-save-the-dates-2) a meteor shower, you should have clear and dark skies, a [comfortable seat](https://png.pngtree.com/png-vector/20240509/ourlarge/pngtree-relax-spa-wellness-dog-body-relax-lazy-png-image_12391632.png), and patience.
