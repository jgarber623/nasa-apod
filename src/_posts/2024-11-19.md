What's happening with these clouds? While it may seem that these [long](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130602.html) and thin clouds are pointing toward the top of a hill, and that maybe a [world-famous observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_astronomical_observatories) is located there, only part of that is true. In terms of [cloud](https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/videos/nasa-our-world-what-cloud)s, the formation is a chance superposition of impressively [periodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function) undulating air currents in [Earth's lower](https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-earths-atmosphere/) atmosphere. [Undulatus](https://cloudappreciationsociety.org/cloud-library/undulatus/), a type of [Asper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperitas_\(cloud\))[it](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180819.html)[as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperitas_\(cloud\)) cloud, form at the peaks where the air is cool enough to [cause](https://climatekids.nasa.gov/cloud-formation/) the condensation of opaque water droplets. The [wide-angle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230702.html) nature of the panorama creates the illusion that the clouds converge over the hill. In terms of land, there really is a world-famous observatory at the top of that peak: the [Carnegie Science](https://carnegiescience.edu/)'s [Las Campanas](https://www.lco.cl/) [Observatory](https://youtu.be/99US2V3xuLw) in the [Atacama Desert](https://youtu.be/o5JfmFSBDgE) of [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile). The two telescope [domes visible](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240127.html) are the 6.5-meter [Magellan Telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellan_Telescopes). The featured coincidental vista was a [surprise](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F2oy3au68a8511.jpg) but was captured by the phone of a quick-thinking photographer in late September.
