It was a night of 100,000 meteors. The [Great Meteor Storm of 1833](https://www.pigeonroost.net/the-great-meteor-storm-of-1833/) was perhaps the most [impressive meteor event](https://earthsky.org/todays-image/leonid-meteor-shower-1833/) in recent history. Best visible over eastern [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) during the pre-dawn hours of November 13, many people -- including a young [Abraham Lincoln](https://davidjkent-writer.com/2022/11/13/lincoln-and-the-leonid-meteor-shower/) -- were woken up to see the [sky erupt](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031116.html) in [streaks](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231217.html) and [flash](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181209.html)es. Hundreds of thousands of [meteors blazed](https://blogs.loc.gov/headlinesandheroes/2020/09/how-newspapers-helped-crowdsource-a-scientific-discovery-the-1833-leonid-meteor-storm/) across the sky, seemingly pouring out of the constellation of the Lion ([Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_\(constellation\))). The [featured image](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leonids-1833.jpg) is a digitization of a [wood engraving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_engraving) which itself was based on a painting from a first-person account. We know today that the [Great Meteor Storm](https://www.space.com/greatest-meteor-storms-in-history) of [1833](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1833) was caused by the Earth moving through a dense part of the [dust trail](https://www.meteorshowers.org/view/Leonids) expelled from [Comet Tempel-Tuttle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap021116.html). The [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) moves through [this dust stream](https://www.meteorshowers.org/view/Leonids) every November during the [Leonid meteor shower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonids). Later this week you might get a slight taste of the [intensity](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fdo-they-realize-we-love-them-and-we-are-their-care-givers-i-v0-z4ly1tlxm7sb1.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D51ed6bea310b899748bfa9290032b3cadb59b60f) of that 1833 meteor storm by [witnessing](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/whats-up-december-2024-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/) the annual [Geminid meteor shower](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211116.html).
