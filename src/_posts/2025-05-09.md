How do black holes create X-rays? Answering this long-standing question was significantly [advanced recently](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250501832A/abstract) with data taken by NASAâ€™s [IXPE](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/imaging-x-ray-polarimetry-explorer-ixpe/) satellite. X-rays cannot exit a [black hole](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/), but they can be created in the [energetic environment nearby](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031128.html), in particular by a [jet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240507.html) of particles moving outward. By observing [X-ray light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays/) arriving from near the [supermassive black hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250504.html) at the center of galaxy [BL Lac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BL_Lacertae), called a [blazar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar), it was discovered that these X-rays lacked significant [polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_\(waves\)), which is expected when created more by energetic [electrons](https://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whelect.html) than [protons](https://home.cern/news/news/physics/proton-century). In the [featured artistic illustration](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/ixpe/nasas-ixpe-reveals-x-ray-generating-particles-in-black-hole-jets/), a powerful [jet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210622.html) is depicted emanating from an orange-colored [accretion disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190820.html) circling the black hole. [Understanding](https://thestatetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Cuteness-640x381.jpg) highly [energetic processes](https://chandra.si.edu/art/xray/) across the universe helps humanity to understand [similar](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/en/) [processes](https://home.cern/science/physics) that occur on or near [our Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/).
