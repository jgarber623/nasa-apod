Saturn looks slightly different in infrared light. Bands of clouds show great structure, including long [stretching storms](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190915.html). Also quite striking in [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) is the unusual [hexagonal cloud pattern](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130220.html) surrounding [Saturn](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/)'s North Pole. Each side of the dark [hexagon](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/hexagon.html) spans roughly the width of our Earth. [The hexagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_hexagon)'s existence was not predicted, and its origin and likely stability remain a [topics of research](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingFunny/comments/16tjsam/this_funny_dog_studying_for_his_obedience_test/#lightbox). Saturn's famous [rings](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/saturn-rings/en/) circle the planet and [cast shadows](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120703.html) below the [equator](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/equator_.png). The featured image was taken by the robotic [Cassini spacecraft](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/the-journey/the-spacecraft/) in 2014 in several infrared colors. In 2017 September, the [Cassini mission](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110613.html) was brought to a dramatic conclusion when the spacecraft was [directed to dive](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170125.html) into the ringed giant.
