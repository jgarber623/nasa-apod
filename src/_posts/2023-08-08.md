What's that below the Moon? Jupiter -- and its largest moons. Many [skygazers](https://earthsky.org/todays-image/best-photos-moon-and-jupiter-june-2023/) across planet Earth enjoyed the close conjunction of [Earth's Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html) passing nearly in front of Jupiter in mid-June. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ct_1FUlIP-F/) is a single exposure of the event taken from [Mor√≥n de la Frontera](https://youtu.be/mUgmGprvNHw), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain). The sunlit lunar crescent on the left is overexposed, while the Moon's night side, on the right, is only faintly illuminated by [Earthshine](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120324.html). Lined up diagonally below the Moon, left to right, are Jupiter's bright Galilean satellites: [Callisto](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/jupiter-moons/callisto/overview/), [Ganymede](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/jupiter-moons/ganymede/overview/), [Io](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/jupiter-moons/io/overview/) (hard to see as it is very near to Jupiter), and [Europa](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/jupiter-moons/europa/overview/). [In fact](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Juice), Callisto, Ganymede, and Io are larger than Earth's Moon, while [Europa](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120524.html) is only slightly smaller. [NASA's](https://www.nasa.gov/) robotic spacecraft [Juno](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html) is currently [orbiting Jupiter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220828.html) and made a [close pass near Io](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-juno-is-getting-ever-closer-to-jupiters-moon-io) only a week ago. If you [look up](https://www.warrenphotographic.co.uk/photography/bigs/32253-Tabby-kitten-looking-up-white-background.jpg) in the [night sky tonight](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/), you will again see two of the brightest objects angularly close together -- because [tonight](https://in-the-sky.org/news.php?id=20230808_20_100) is another [Moon-Jupiter conjunction](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190902.html).
