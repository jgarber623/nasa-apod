Have you ever seen a rocket launch -- from space? A close inspection of [the featured time-lapse video](https://youtu.be/B1R3dTdcpSU) will reveal a rocket rising to Earth orbit as seen from the [International Space Station](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/) (ISS). The [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia)n [Soyuz-FG rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz-FG) was launched in November 2018 from the [Baikonur Cosmodrome](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia16292-baikonur-cosmodrome-kazakhstan/) in [Kazakhstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan), carrying a [Progress MS-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_MS-10) (also [71P](https://spaceflightnow.com/tag/progress-71p/)) module to bring needed supplies to the ISS. Highlights in the [90-second video](https://youtu.be/aJy1u-N3NY0) (condensing about 15-minutes) include city lights and clouds [visible](https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/) on the Earth on the lower left, blue and gold bands of [atmospheric airglow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140803.html) running diagonally across the center, and distant stars on the upper right that set behind the Earth. A lower stage can be seen [falling back to Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160802.html) as the robotic supply ship fires its thrusters and begins to [close on the ISS](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080514.html), a [space laboratory](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151109.html) that celebrated its [25th anniversary](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-leaders-to-highlight-25th-anniversary-of-space-station-with-crew/) in 2023. [Astronauts](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/) who live aboard the [Earth-orbiting ISS](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161105.html) conduct, among more practical duties, [numerous science experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_research_on_the_International_Space_Station) that expand human knowledge and enable [future commercial industry](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-space/low-earth-orbit-economy/) in [low Earth orbit](https://www.universetoday.com/85322/what-is-low-earth-orbit/).
