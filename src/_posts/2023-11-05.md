It was Halloween and the sky looked like a creature. Exactly which creature, the [astrophotographer was unsure](http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=32252&start=225#p212559) (but [possibly you can suggest one](https://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=231105)). Exactly what caused this [eerie apparition](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221030.html) in 2013 was sure: one of the best [auroral displays](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130609.html) that year. This [spectacular aurora](https://spaceweathergallery.com/index.php?title=aurora) had an unusually high degree of [detail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap020115.html). Pictured [here](http://arcticlightphoto.photoshelter.com/gallery-image/News/G0000ABqHEeXXLF8/I0000s_hNlyttARI), the vivid green and purple [auroral colors](https://annex.exploratorium.edu/learning_studio/auroras/difcolors.html) are caused by high atmospheric [oxygen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml) and [nitrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/7.shtml) reacting to a burst of incoming [electrons](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200010/history.cfm). Birch [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch) in [Troms√∏](https://youtu.be/kSMgRWt9NHg), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway) formed an also [eerie foreground](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c4/da/bf/c4dabff6de32983eb430ff204334fb5b.jpg). Frequently, new [photogenic auroras](http://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=aurora) accompany new [geomagnetic storms](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/31248/).
