It's so big it is easy to miss. The [entire Veil Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191031.html) spans six times the diameter of the [full moon](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5048), but is so dim you need [binoculars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binoculars#/media/File:Binocularp.svg) to see it. The nebula was created about [15,000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_prehistory) when a star in the [constellation](https://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations/) of the Swan ([Cygnus](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/cygnus.html)) exploded. The [spectacular explosion](https://youtu.be/7zCPgdcdB5Q) would have [appeared brighter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211114.html) than even [Venus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230915.html) for a week - but there is [no known record](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d1/1a/62/d11a627b5fe41146b7afa313548c2119.jpg) of it. Pictured is the western edge of the still-expanding gas cloud. Notable gas filaments include the [Witch's Broom Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180408.html) on the upper left near the bright foreground star [52 Cygni](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/52cyg.html), and [Fleming's Triangular Wisp](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210727.html) (formerly known as [Pickering's Triangle](https://www.davidcortner.com/slowblog/20161113.php)) running diagonally up the image middle. What is rarely imaged -- but seen in the featured long exposure across many color bands -- is the reflecting brown [dust](https://herscheltelescope.org.uk/science/infrared/dust/) that runs vertically up the image left, dust likely created in the cool atmospheres of massive [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/).
