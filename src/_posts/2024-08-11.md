Where do Perseid meteors come from? Mostly small bits of stony grit, [Perseid meteoroids](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/perseids/) were once expelled from [Comet Swift-Tuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Swift%E2%80%93Tuttle) and continue to follow this comet's orbit as they slowly disperse. The [featured animation](https://www.meteorshowers.org/view/Perseids) depicts the entire meteoroid stream as it orbits [our Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/). When the Earth nears this stream, as it does every year, the [Perseid Meteor Shower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids) occurs. Highlighted as bright in the animation, [comet debris](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240106.html) this size is usually so dim it is practically undetectable. Only a small fraction of this debris will enter the [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-earths-atmosphere/), heat up and [disintegrate brightly](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011118.html). Tonight and the next few nights promise some of the better skies to view the [Perseid shower](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170818.html) as well as [other active showers](http://cams.seti.org/FDL/) because the [first quarter moon](https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/54/phases-of-the-moon/) will be [absent](https://www.reddit.com/r/FindTheSniper/comments/1chffk6/find_the_cat/) from [the sky](https://science.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/) from [midnight onward](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-perseid-meteor-shower/).
