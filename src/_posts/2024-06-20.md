Last April's Full Moon shines [through high clouds](https://greenflash.photo/portfolio/lunar-halo/) near the horizon, casting shadows in this garden-at-night skyscape. Along with canine sentinel Sandy watching the garden gate, the wide-angle snapshot also captured the [bright Moon's](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220514.html) 22 degree ice halo. But June's bright Full Moon will cast shadows too. [This month, the Moon's](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/the-next-full-moon-is-the-strawberry-moon-2/) exact full phase occurs at 01:08 UTC June 22. That's a mere 28 hours or so after [today's June solstice](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-june-solstice/) (at 20:51 UTC June 20), the moment when the Sun reaches its maximum northern declination. Known to some as a Strawberry Moon, June's Full Moon is at its southernmost declination, and of course will create its own [22 degree halos](https://atoptics.co.uk/blog/22-halo-formation/) in hazy night skies.
