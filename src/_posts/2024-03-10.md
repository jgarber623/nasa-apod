Would you go to the end of the world to see a total eclipse of the Sun? If you did, would you be surprised to find someone else [there already?](http://www.icstars.com/Antarctica/Eclipse2003.html) In 2003, the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/), the Moon, Antarctica, and two photographers all lined up in [Antarctica](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap991116.html) during an unusual [total solar eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100730.html). Even given the extreme location, a group of [enthusiastic eclipse chasers](http://www.moonglow.net/eclipse/2003nov23/index.html) ventured near the bottom of the world to [experience the surreal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUNau9YjA2U) momentary disappearance of the [Sun behind the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240303.html). One of the treasures collected was the [featured picture](http://www.moonglow.net/eclipse/2003nov23/index.html) -- a composite of four separate images digitally combined to realistically simulate how the adaptive human [eye saw](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230516.html) the eclipse. As the image was taken, both the [Moon and the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031127.html) peeked together over an Antarctic ridge. In the [sudden darkness](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211205.html), the [magnificent corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100316.html) of the Sun became visible around the Moon. Quite by accident, another photographer was [caught](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2F6KSS0cdkLrB6oSpJFbgcLAa36Nk312Q3EaEWf_TRDu0.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Db6f2617acbc01d2e5c81ae47ff7dcc65f743e94d) in one of the images checking his video camera. Visible to his left are an equipment bag and a [collapsible chair](http://www.abriefourie.com/crossingcontinue_01.html). A more easily visible solar eclipse will occur in just under four weeks and [be visible](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/) from a long, thin swath of North America.
