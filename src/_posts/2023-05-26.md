[Galaxies of the Virgo Cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150804.html) are scattered across this nearly 4 degree wide [telescopic field of view](https://www.astrobin.com/cvyhhu/0/). About 50 million light-years distant, the Virgo Cluster is the closest large galaxy cluster to our own local galaxy group. Prominent here are Virgo's bright elliptical galaxies [Messier catalog](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-s-messier-catalog), M87 at bottom center, and M84 and M86 (top to bottom) near top left. M84 and M86 are recognized as part of [Markarian's Chain](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090609.html), a visually striking line-up of galaxies on the left side of this frame. Near the middle of the chain lies an intriguing interacting pair of galaxies, NGC 4438 and NGC 4435, known to some as [Markarian's Eyes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070608.html). Of course [giant elliptical galaxy M87](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230504.html) dominates the Virgo cluster. It's the home of a super massive black hole, the first black hole ever imaged by planet Earth's [Event Horizon Telescope](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/about).
