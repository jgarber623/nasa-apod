[Northern lights](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231125.html) shine in this night skyview from planet Earth's stratosphere, captured on January 15. The single, 5 second exposure was made with a hand-held camera on board an [aircraft](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191010.html) above Winnipeg, Canada. During the exposure, terrestrial lights below leave colorful trails along the direction of motion of the speeding aircraft. Above the more distant horizon, [energetic particles accelerated](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/sounding-rockets/rockets-to-uncover-electric-circuit-that-powers-the-northern-lights/) along Earth's magnetic field at the [planet's polar regions](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast) excite atomic oxygen to create the shimmering [display of Aurora Borealis](https://www.aurorasaurus.org/). The aurora's characteristic greenish hue is generated at altitudes of 100-300 kilometers and red at even higher altitudes and lower atmospheric densities. The luminous glow of faint stars along the plane of our Milky Way galaxy arcs through the night, while the Andromeda galaxy extends this northern skyview to [extragalactic](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211106.html) space. A diffuse hint of Andromeda, the closest large spiral to the Milky Way, can just be seen to the upper left.
