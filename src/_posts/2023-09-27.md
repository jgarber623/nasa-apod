Not every road ends in a STEVE. A week ago, a sky enthusiast's journey began with a goal: to photograph an [aurora](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/) over [Lake Huron](https://youtu.be/iM73QjPiiwU). Driving through rural [Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada), the forecasted sky show started [unexpectedly early](https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&day=18&month=09&year=2023), causing the photographer to stop before arriving at the scenic [Great Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes). Aurora images were taken toward the north -- but over land, not sea. While waiting for a second round of auroras, a [peculiar band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210505.html) of light was noticed to the west. Slowly, the photographer and friends realized that this western band was likely an unusual type of aurora: a [Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEVE) (STEVE). Moreover, this [STEVE](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201117.html) was putting on quite a show: appearing intertwined with the central band of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/) while intersecting the horizon just near the end of the country road. After capturing [this cosmic X](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxZdU7rsPiW/) on camera, the photographer paused to appreciate the [unexpected awesomeness](https://medicaregranny.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/5cfa3122210000690de6bfca.jpeg) of finding extraordinary beauty in an ordinary setting.
