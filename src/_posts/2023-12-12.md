What are these two giant arches across the sky? Perhaps the more familiar one, on the left, is the central band of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/). This grand disk of stars and nebulas here appears to encircle much of the southern sky. Visible below the stellar arch is the [rusty-orange](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970804.html) planet [Mars](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/) and the extended [Andromeda galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150830.html). But this night had more! For a few minutes during this [cold](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DKSyMr2UEAAUL70?format=jpg) arctic night, a second [giant arch](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200531.html) appeared encircling part of the northern sky: an [aurora](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/en/). Auroras are much closer than stars as they are composed of glowing air high in [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html). Visible outside the [green auroral arch](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190322.html) is the group of stars popularly [known](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210112.html) as the [Big Dipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper). The [featured digital composite](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0OjdSZI8kS/) of 20 images was captured in mid-November 2022 over the [Lofoten Islands](https://youtu.be/mg67iIFivDo) in [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway).
