Forget [X-ray vision](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays/) — imagine what you could see with [gamma-ray](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/12_gammarays/) vision! The [featured all-sky map](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/14090/) shows what the universe looks like to NASA's [Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/fermi). Fermi sees light with energies about a billion times what the [human eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye#/media/File:3D_Medical_Animation_Eye_Structure.jpg) can see, and [the map](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-dXEVkyGCj/) combines 12 years of Fermi observations. The colors represent the brightness of the [gamma-ray sources](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230906.html), with brighter sources appearing lighter in color. The prominent stripe across the middle is the central plane of our [Milky Way galaxy](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/milkyway1.html). Most of the red and yellow dots scattered above and below the Milky Way’s plane are very [distant galaxies](https://nasa.tumblr.com/post/171449548004/the-universes-brightest-lights-have-some-dark), while most of those within [the plane](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180313.html) are nearby [pulsars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/neutron-stars-are-weird/). The [blue](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210826.html) background that fills the image is the [diffuse glow of gamma-rays](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/diffuse_background1.html) from distant sources that are too dim to be detected individually. Some gamma-ray sources [remain unidentified](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/observatories/satellite/compton/unidentified.html) and topics of research — currently [no one knows](https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/03/88/96/18/360_F_388961826_N9HqeJkq9qagMtXaFPMfdK9qawWj4T2H.jpg) what they are.
