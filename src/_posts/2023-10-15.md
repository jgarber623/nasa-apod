Yes, but can your tree do this? If you look closely at the ground in the featured image, you will see many images of [yesterday's solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2023/where-when) -- created by a tree. Gaps between tree leaves act like [pinhole](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/learn/project/how-to-make-a-pinhole-camera/) lenses and each create a [small image](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap001225.html) of the partially [eclipsed Sun](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/eclipse-snap/en/) visible in the other direction. The image was taken in [Burleson](https://youtu.be/Gb6C87BeEaE), [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). Yesterday, people across the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas) were [treated](https://hiawasseevet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/smiling-cat-for-web.jpg) to a [partial eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191227.html) of the Sun, when the Moon moves in front of part of the Sun. People in a [narrow band](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2023/where-when) of Earth were treated to an [annular eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100122.html), also called a [ring-of-fire eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200615.html), when the Moon becomes completely [engulfed by the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230910.html) and sunlight streams around all of the [Moon's edges](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230917.html). In answer to the [lede](https://www.thoughtco.com/how-to-write-a-great-lede-2074346) question, your tree not only can [do this](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170320.html), but _will_ do it every time that a visible solar eclipse passes overhead. Next April 8, a deeper, [total solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/) will move across [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America).
