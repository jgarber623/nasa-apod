A bright comet will be visible during next month's total solar eclipse. This very [unusual coincidence](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stunning-comet-could-photobomb-this-aprils-total-solar-eclipse/) occurs because [Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12P/Pons%E2%80%93Brooks)'s return to the inner Solar System places it by chance only [25 degrees](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/degrees.html) away from the Sun during Earth's [April 8 total solar eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230418.html). Currently [the comet](https://youtu.be/BRlZlw1xw3A?t=107) is just on the [edge of visibility](https://theskylive.com/how-bright-is-12p) to the unaided eye, best visible with binoculars in the early evening sky toward the [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/en/) of the Fish ([Pisces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisces_(constellation))). [Comet Pons-Brooks](https://theskylive.com/12p-info), though, is putting on quite a show for deep camera images even now. The [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/eqxd1j/B/) is a [composite](https://media.gettyimages.com/id/200202597-001/photo/man-and-woman-metamorphasised-as-cat-and-dog.jpg?s=1024x1024&w=gi&k=20&c=rJB50XdSMxn9imcozdd2_f-HDv7S8TQEmy04gg1NofE=) of three very specific colors, showing the comet's ever-changing [ion tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200429.html) in light blue, its outer [coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_(comet)) in green, and highlights some red-glowing gas around the coma in a [spiral](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240101.html). The spiral is thought to be caused by gas being expelled by the slowly [rotating nucleus](https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=16508) of the giant iceberg comet. Although it is always difficult to predict the future brightness of comets, [Comet Pons-Brook](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240216.html) has been particularly prone to [outbursts](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/see-comet-12p-pons-brooks-in-outburst/), making it even more difficult to predict how bright it will actually be as the [Moon moves in front of the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170820.html) on [April 8](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/).
