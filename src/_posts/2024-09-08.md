The most distant object easily visible to the unaided eye is [M31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), the great [Andromeda Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-31/). Even at some two and a half million [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/)s distant, this immense spiral galaxy -- spanning [over](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061228.html) 200,000 light years -- is visible, although as a faint, nebulous cloud in the [constellation Andromeda](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/and/index.html). A bright yellow nucleus, dark winding [dust lanes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220117.html), and expansive spiral arms dotted with [blue star cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211124.html)s and [red nebulae](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210214.html), are recorded in [this stunning telescopic image](http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/M31-HST-Subaru-NOAO-RC.html) which combines data from [orbiting Hubble](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/about-hubble/) with ground-based images from [Subaru](https://subarutelescope.org/en/) and [Mayall](https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/kitt-peak-national-observatory/nicholas-mayall-4m-telescope/). In only about 5 billion years, the Andromeda galaxy may be even [easier to see](https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/621501.jpg) -- as it will likely span the entire night sky -- just before it [merges](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220606.html) with, or [passes right](https://www.science.org/content/article/milky-way-may-escape-fated-collision-andromeda-galaxy) by, our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/milkyway1.html).
