Is this a painting or a photograph? In this celestial [abstract art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art) composed with a cosmic brush, dusty nebula [NGC 2170](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_2170), also known as the Angel Nebula, shines just above the image center. Reflecting the light of nearby hot stars, [NGC 2170](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070228.html) is joined by other bluish [reflection](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/reflection_nebulae.html) nebulae, a red [emission](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/emission_nebulae.html) region, many dark [absorption nebulae](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/dark_nebulae.html), and a backdrop of [colorful stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080803.html). Like the common household items that [abstract painters](https://www.thecollector.com/famous-abstract-artists/) often choose for their subjects, the clouds of gas, dust, and hot stars [featured here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtA99Xyp86S/) are also commonly found in a setting like this one -- a massive, star-forming molecular cloud in the constellation of the [Unicorn](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/45/b7/eb/45b7eb6cdfa79df25c1d28e0d4a6f1c2.jpg) ([Monoceros](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/mon/index.html)). The giant [molecular cloud](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/m/Molecular+Cloud), [Mon R2](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997AJ....114..198C/abstract), is impressively close, [estimated](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...430..523W/abstract) to be only 2,400 [light-years](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) or so away. At that distance, this [canvas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL5KZWDe8x8) would be over 60 light-years across.
