Did you see it? One of the more common questions during a [meteor shower](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/meteor-shower/) occurs because the time it takes for a meteor to flash is similar to the time it takes for a head to turn. Possibly, though, the glory of seeing [bright meteors](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230809.html) shoot across the sky -- while knowing that they were once small [pebbles](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/facts/) on [another world](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151118.html) -- might make it all worthwhile, even if your observing partner(s) can't always share in your experience. The [featured video](https://youtu.be/CwrvN0Q9_Sg) is composed of short clips taken in [Inner Mongolia](https://youtu.be/1NnMJUvU1L0), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) during the 2023 [Perseid Meteor Shower](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/perseids/). Several bright meteors were captured while [live-reaction audio](https://youtu.be/olq7Qr1H_PI) was being recorded -- just as the [meteors flashed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181209.html). This year's [2024 Perseids](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240812.html) also produced [many beautiful meteors](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.488496753878907&type=3). Another [good meteor shower](https://www.space.com/39469-best-meteor-showers.html) to watch for is the [Geminids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminids) which peak yearly in mid-December, this year with relatively little competing glow from a nearly new Moon.
