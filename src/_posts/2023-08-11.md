An intriguing pair of interacting galaxies, M51 is [the 51st entry](http://messier.obspm.fr/m/m051.html) in Charles Messier's famous catalog. Perhaps the [original spiral nebula](http://messier.seds.org/more/m051_rosse.html), the large galaxy with whirlpool-like spiral structure seen nearly face-on is also cataloged as NGC 5194. Its [spiral arms and dust lanes](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-51-the-whirlpool-galaxy) sweep in front of a companion galaxy (right), [NGC 5195](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130831.html). Some 31 million light-years distant, within the boundaries of the well-trained constellation [Canes Venatici](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cvn/index.html), M51 looks faint and fuzzy to the eye in direct telescopic views. [But this remarkably deep image](https://www.astrobin.com/7hwtz0/) shows off stunning details of the galaxy pair's striking colors and extensive [tidal debris](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200108.html). A collaboration of astro-imagers using telescopes on planet Earth combined over 10 days of exposure time to [create this definitive galaxy portrait of M51](https://theastroenthusiast.com/m51-processing/). The image includes 118 hours of narrowband data that also reveals a vast glowing cloud of reddish ionized hydrogen gas [discovered in the M51 system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01699).
