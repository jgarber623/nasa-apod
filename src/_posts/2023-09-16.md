On September 12, from a location just south of the Arctic Circle, stones of Iceland's [modern Arctic Henge](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230327.html) point skyward in this startling scene. Entertaining an intrepid group of aurora hunters during a [geomagnetic storm](https://spaceweather.com/), alluring northern lights dance across the darkened sky when a stunning [fireball meteor](https://www.amsmeteors.org/fireballs/faqf/) explodes. Awestruck, the camera-equipped skygazers [captured video and still images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHHitRCagcE) of the boreal bolide, at its peak about as bright as a full moon. Though quickly fading from view, the fireball left a lingering [visible trail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2309/_DSC7281-1s_1024.jpg) or persistent train. [The wraith-like trail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180817.html) was seen for minutes wafting in the upper atmosphere at altitudes of 60 to 90 kilometers along with the [auroral glow](https://www.nasa.gov/aurora).
