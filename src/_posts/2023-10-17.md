It's not the big ring that's attracting the most attention. Although the big planet-forming ring around the star [PDS 70](https://youtu.be/Cslrr2koNvU) is clearly imaged and itself quite interesting. It's also not the planet on the right, just inside the [big disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap041019.html), thatâ€™s being talked about the most. Although the planet [PDS 70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDS_70)c is a newly formed and, interestingly, similar in size and mass to [Jupiter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190908.html). It's the fuzzy patch around the [planet PDS 70c](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/7414/pds-70-c/) that's [causing the commotion](https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/animals-looking-through-the-window-201.jpg). That fuzzy patch is thought to be a [dusty disk](https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2111/) that is now forming into moons -- and that had never been seen before. The [featured image](https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso2111b/) was taken in 2021 by the [Atacama Large Millimeter Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array) (ALMA) of 66 [radio telescopes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140526.html) in the high [Atacama Desert](https://youtu.be/o5JfmFSBDgE) of northern [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile). Based on ALMA data, [astronomers infer](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...916L...2B/abstract) that the moon-forming exoplanetary disk has a radius similar to our Earth's orbit, and may one day form three or so [Luna](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Luna#Proper_noun)\-sized moons -- not very different from our [Jupiter](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/)'s [four](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/the-galilean-satellites).
