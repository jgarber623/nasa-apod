A supermoon occurred yesterday. And tonight's moon should also look impressive. [Supermoons](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/moon/what-is-a-supermoon/) appear slightly larger and brighter than most full moons because they reach their full phase when [slightly nearer to the Earth](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/what-is-a-supermoon/) -- closer than 90 percent of all [full moons](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html). This supermoon was also a blue moon given the definition that it is the third of four full moons occurring during a single season. [Blue moons](https://moon.nasa.gov/news/197/super-blue-moons-your-questions-answered/) are not usually blue, and a different definition holds that a [blue moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210831.html) is the second full moon that occurs during a single month. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-3NZVEOdaV/) captured the [blue supermoon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230905.html) right near its peak size yesterday as it was rising [beyond](https://youtu.be/mGl5ALlUI-Q?t=39) the [Temple of Poseidon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Poseidon,_Sounion) in [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece). [This supermoon](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/a-rare-super-blue-moon-will-be-visible-monday-night-what-does-that-mean-180984928) is particularly unusual in that it is the [first of four](https://i2.pickpik.com/photos/19/144/45/cat-feeding-young-cat-animal-preview.jpg) successive supermoons, the next three occurring in September, October, and November.
