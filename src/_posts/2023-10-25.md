In 60 seconds, this setting Sun will turn green. Actually, the top of [the Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) already appears not only green, but wavey -- along with all of its edges. The Sun itself is unchanged -- both [effects](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090223.html) are caused by looking along hot and cold layers in [Earth's atmosphere](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2919/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/). The unusual color is known as a [green flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_flash) and occurs because these atmospheric layers not only shift background images but disperse colors into slightly different directions, like a [prism](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/bending-light/latest/bending-light_en.html). The featured video was captured earlier this month off the coast of [Hawai](https://youtu.be/dB-qilyUX2Q)[i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii), [USA](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/). After [waiting](https://i.cbc.ca/1.6583971.1663276172!/fileImage/httpImage/cat-boredom.jpg) those 60 seconds, at the video's end, the upper part of [the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230222.html) seems to hover alone in space, while turning not only [green](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230328.html), but [blue](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110104.html). Then suddenly, the Sun appears to shrink to nothing -- only to return tomorrow.
