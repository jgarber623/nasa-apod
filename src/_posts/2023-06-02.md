Big, beautiful spiral galaxy M101 is one of the last entries in [Charles Messier's](https://www.nasa.gov/content/explore-the-night-sky-hubble-s-messier-catalog-bio) famous catalog, but definitely not [one](https://www.messier.seds.org/m/m102d.html) of the least. About 170,000 light-years across, this galaxy is enormous, almost twice the size of our own Milky Way. M101 was also one of the original [spiral nebulae](https://www.messier.seds.org/more/m101_rosse.html) observed by Lord Rosse's large 19th century telescope, the [Leviathan](https://birrcastle.com/telescope-astronomy/) of Parsontown. Assembled from 51 exposures recorded by the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://hubblesite.org/) in the 20th and 21st centuries, with additional data from ground based telescopes, this mosaic spans about 40,000 light-years across the central region of M101 in one of the highest definition spiral galaxy portraits ever released from Hubble. [The sharp image shows stunning features](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2006/10/1865-Image.html) of the galaxy's face-on disk of stars and dust along with background galaxies, some visible right through M101 itself. Also known as the [Pinwheel Galaxy, M101](https://www.messier.seds.org/m/m101.html) lies within the boundaries of the northern constellation [Ursa Major](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160123.html), about 25 million light-years away.
