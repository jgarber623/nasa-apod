What's happening in the sky above Stonehenge? A meteor shower: specifically, the [Perseid meteor shower](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/perseids/). A few nights ago, after the [sky darkened](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240228.html), many images of meteors from this year's [Perseids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids) were captured separately and merged into a single frame. Although the [meteors all](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240811.html) traveled on straight paths, these paths appear slightly curved by the wide-angle lens of the capturing camera. The [meteor streaks](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161213.html) can all be traced back to a single point on the sky called the [radiant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_\(meteor_shower\)), here just off the top of the frame in the [constellation of Perseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_\(constellation\)). The same camera took a deep image of the background sky that brought up the [central band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240805.html) of our [Milky Way galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) running nearly vertical through the image center. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-hUGnvsliD/) was taken from [Wiltshire](https://youtu.be/6rUFClgsrnQ), [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), being careful to include, at the bottom, the famous astronomical monument of [Stonehenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge). Although the [Perseids](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/night-sky-network/prepare-for-perseids/) peaked last night, some Perseid meteors should [still be visible](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/8572855808/hBCCED02B/cute-cat-hiding-hey-whered-she-go) for a few more nights.
