Near the center of this sharp cosmic portrait, at the heart of [the Orion Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090222.html), are four hot, massive stars [known as the Trapezium](http://messier.seds.org/more/m042_trapezium.html). Gathered within a region about 1.5 light-years in radius, they dominate the core of the dense Orion Nebula Star Cluster. [Ultraviolet](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) ionizing radiation from the [Trapezium stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezium_Cluster), mostly from the brightest star [Theta-1 Orionis C](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/theta1ori.html) powers the complex star forming region's entire visible glow. About three million years old, the Orion Nebula Cluster was even more compact in its younger years and a [dynamical study](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...757...37S) indicates that [runaway stellar collisions](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/a-black-hole-in-orion/) at an earlier age may have formed a [black hole](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/black-holes/) with more than 100 times the mass of the Sun. The presence of a [black hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141026.html) within the cluster could explain the observed high velocities of the [Trapezium stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170321.html). The Orion Nebula's distance of some 1,500 light-years would make it one of the [closest known black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_black_holes) to planet Earth.
