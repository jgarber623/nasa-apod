Does lightning occur only on Earth? No. Spacecraft in our Solar System have detected lightning on other planets, including [Mars](https://esto.nasa.gov/first-direct-measurements-of-lightning-on-mars/), [Jupiter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap971216.html) and [Saturn](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080505.html), and lightning is likely on [Venus](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05930), [Uranus, and Neptune](https://eos.org/features/planetary-lightning-same-physics-distant-worlds). Lightning is a [sudden rush](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120723.html) of electrically charged particles from one location to another. [On Earth](https://www.lightningmaps.org/), drafts of colliding ice and water droplets usually create lightning-generating charge separation, but [what happens on Jupiter](https://as1.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/04/78/17/62/1000_F_478176241_p5m7EUHkXjdNiStGknkInH6KvCbwm3NE.jpg)? Images and data from NASA's [Jupiter-orbiting](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220828.html) Juno [spacecraft](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/spacecraft/) bolster previous speculation that [Jovian lightning](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022DPS....5430203B/abstract) is also created in clouds containing water and ice. In the [featured Juno photograph](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA25020), an optical flash was captured in a large cloud vortex near [Jupiter's north pole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180308.html). During the next few months, Juno will perform several close sweeps over Jupiter's night side, likely allowing the robotic probe to capture more data and images of [Jovian lightning](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970512.html).
