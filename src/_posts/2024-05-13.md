It was larger than the Earth. It was so big you could actually see it on the Sun's surface without magnification. It contained powerful and [tangled magnetic fields](https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/help/the-magnetic-classification-of-sunspots.html) as well as numerous [dark sunspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot)s. Labelled [AR 3664](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240511.html), it developed into one of the most energetic areas seen on the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) in recent years, unleashing a series of explosions that led to a surge of energetic particles striking the Earth, which created [beautiful auroras](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240512.html). [And might continue](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-viewline-tonight-and-tomorrow-night-experimental). Although [active regions](https://science.nasa.gov/get-involved/citizen-science/be-a-solar-active-region-spotter/) on the Sun like AR 3664 can be quite dangerous, this region's [Coronal Mass Ejections](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180902.html) have not done, as yet, much [damage to Earth-orbiting satellites](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5214/) or [Earth-surface electrical grids](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/images/u33/finalBoulderPresentation042611%20%281%29.pdf). [Pictured](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=431389876256262&set=a.431368006258449), the enormous active region was captured on the setting Sun a few days ago from [Civitavecchia](https://youtu.be/mL__aBb8Hlg), [Rome](https://youtu.be/oSexfR0Ubzw), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). The [composite image](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=431389876256262&set=a.431368006258449) includes a very short exposure taken of just the [Sun's surface](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111106.html), but mimics what was actually visible. Finally, [AR 3664](https://spaceweather.com/images2024/12may24/hmi1898.gif) is [now rotating away](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZjBEW+qNL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg) from the Earth, although the region may survive long enough to [come around again](https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/90/92/89/360_F_190928973_1rQ1nipXxnL6Y28MIL5OlY69MNFTsM9k.jpg).
