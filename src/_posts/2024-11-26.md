This floating ring is the size of a galaxy. In fact, it is a galaxy -- or at least part of one: the photogenic [Sombrero Galaxy](http://messier.seds.org/m/m104.html) is one of the largest galaxies in the nearby [Virgo Cluster of Galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050213.html). The dark band of [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html) that obscures the mid-section of the [Sombrero Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sombrero_galaxy) in visible light (bottom panel) actually [glows brightly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/15muzu/set_up_a_security_cam_to_check_up_on_the_cats/#lightbox) in infrared light (top panel). The [featured image](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/137/01JCGMPWZ9NE1M4RHXSAQ36DH6) shows the [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) glow in false blue, recorded recently by the space-based [James Webb Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/) (JWST) and released yesterday, pictured above an [archival](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220423.html) image taken by NASA's [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/about) in [visible](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight) light. The [Sombrero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sombrero) Galaxy, also known as [M104](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBB2xQe8nMw), spans about 50,000 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) and lies 28 million light years away. [M104](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070505.html) can be seen with a small telescope in the direction of the constellation [Virgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_\(constellation\)).
