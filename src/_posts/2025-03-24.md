If the full Moon suddenly faded, what would you see? The answer was recorded in a dramatic time lapse video taken during the total lunar [eclipse last week](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250315.html) from [Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay). During a [total lunar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse#Total_lunar_eclipse), the Earth moves between the [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/) and the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/), causing the Moon to fade dramatically. The [Moon never gets completely dark](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211201.html), though, since the Earth's atmosphere [refracts](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/refr.html) some light. As the featured video begins, the scene may appear to be daytime and sunlit, but actually it is nighttime and lit by the glow of the full Moon. As the [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/) becomes eclipsed and fades, background stars become visible. Most spectacularly, the [sky surrounding](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110617.html) the eclipsed moon suddenly appears to be [full of stars](https://youtu.be/1DNbkKBW0K8) and highlighted by the busy plane of our [Milky Way Galaxy](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html). Nearly two hours after the eclipse started, the Moon emerged from the Earth's shadow and its bright full [glare](https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-cat-glare-745763242.jpg) again dominated the sky.
