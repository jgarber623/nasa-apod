A bright comet is moving into the evening skies. [C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan–ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_\(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS\)) has brightened and even though it is now easily [visible](https://theskylive.com/c2023a3-info) to the unaided eye, it is so near to the Sun that it is still difficult to see. [Pictured](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astrofotografiadesdeperu/54038260392/), Comet [Tsuchinshan–ATLAS](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240930.html) was captured just before sunrise from an [Andes Mountain](https://youtu.be/k6082aNwPEk) in [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru). Braving cold weather, this unusually [high perch](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110417.html) gave the astrophotographer such a low eastern horizon that the [comet](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/) was obvious in the pre-dawn sky. Visible in the [featured image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astrofotografiadesdeperu/54038260392/) is not only an [impressively long](https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/5e37fbed56a82_x049wyu58bx31__700.jpg) dust tail extending over [many degrees](https://www.geogebra.org/m/atq6mr3a), but an impressively long and blue [ion tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240326.html), too.  This month, as the [comet moves](https://www.facebook.com/APOD.Sky/videos/1193871551716124) out from the [Sun](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/menu/sun/) and passes the [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html), evening observers should be able to see the huge dirty [ice ball](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151118.html) toward the west just after [sunset](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240319.html).
