It seemed like the sky exploded. The original idea was to photograph an [aurora](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/en/) over a waterfall. After waiting for hours under opaque [clouds](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-are-clouds-58.html), though, hope was running out. Others left. Then, unexpectedly, the clouds moved away. Suddenly, [particles](https://annex.exploratorium.edu/learning_studio/auroras/happen.html) from a large solar magnetic storm were visible impacting the [Earth's upper atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html) with full effect. The night sky filled with [colors](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170306.html) and motion in a [thrilling](https://www.petsworld.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Happy_Cat_Smiling.jpg) auroral display. Struggling to steady the camera from [high Earthly winds](https://youtu.be/rKUipxR3bDc), the 34 exposures that compose the featured image were taken. The [resulting featured composite image](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cto7pd9O_oD/) shows the photogenic Godafoss (Go√∞afoss) waterfall in northern [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland) in front of a very [active aurora](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130517.html) in late February. The [solar surface explosion](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190526.html) that expelled the energetic particles occurred a [few days before](https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?day=25&month=02&year=2023&view=view). Our Sun is showing an impressive amount of [surface activity](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141022.html) as it approaches [solar maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum), indicating that more impressive auroras are likely to appear in Earth's [northern and southern sky](http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/211.fall2000.web.projects/Christina%20Shaw/WhereCanSee.html) over the next few years.
