Point your telescope toward the high flying constellation [Pegasus](https://earthsky.org/constellations/pegasus-the-winged-horse-autumn-skies/) and you can find this cosmic expanse of [Milky Way stars and distant galaxies](https://throughlightandtime.com/ngc-7814-lrgb-crop-cdk-1000-8-sept-2024/). NGC 7814 is centered in the sharp field of view that would almost be [covered by](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130801.html) a full moon. [NGC 7814 is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7814) sometimes called the [Little Sombrero](https://science.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/goddard/hubbles-little-sombrero/) for its resemblance to the brighter more famous M104, [the Sombrero Galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241126.html). Both Sombrero and Little Sombrero are spiral galaxies seen edge-on, and both have [extensive halos](https://www.iaa.csic.es/en/news/enigmatic-assembly-process-sombrero-galaxy) and central bulges cut by a thin disk with thinner dust lanes in silhouette. [In fact](http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3867), NGC 7814 is some 40 million light-years away and an estimated 60,000 light-years across. That actually makes the [Little Sombrero](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubbles-little-sombrero) about the same physical size as its better known namesake, appearing smaller and fainter only because it is farther away.
