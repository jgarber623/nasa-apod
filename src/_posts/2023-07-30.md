Admire the beauty but fear the beast. The beauty is the [aurora overhead](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120430.html), here taking the form of a great green [spiral](https://originalbeauty.wordpress.com/2009/06/27/spirals-in-nature/), seen between picturesque clouds with the bright Moon to the side and stars in the background. The beast is the wave of charged particles that creates the [aurora](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960527.html) but might, one day, impair civilization. In 1859, following [notable](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/cat-dog-looking-up-isolated-white-background-40403239.jpg) auroras seen all across the globe, a pulse of charged particles from a [coronal mass ejection](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/CMEs.shtml) (CME) associated with a [solar flare](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031029.html) impacted Earth's [magnetosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/magnetosphere-ionosphere) so forcefully that it created the [Carrington Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event). This assault from the Sun compressed the [Earth's magnetic field](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/gallery/Earths-magneticfieldlines-dipole.html) so violently that it created [high currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction) and [sparks](https://youtu.be/U8skz484Ctk) along [telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_telegraph) wires, shocking many [telegraph operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphist#/media/File:COLLECTIE_TROPENMUSEUM_Telegrafist_die_telegrammen_ontvangt_op_Sabang_TMnr_10022280.jpg). Were a [Carrington-class event](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/02may_superstorm/) to impact the Earth today, speculation holds that [damage might occur](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-damage-could-be-caused-by-a-massive-solar-storm-25627394/) to global power grids and electronics on a scale never yet experienced. The featured aurora was imaged in 2016 over [Thingvallavatn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Eingvallavatn) Lake in [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland), a lake that partly fills a fault that [divides](https://youtu.be/Bhu2umi0QII) Earth's large Eurasian and North American [tectonic plates](https://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/tectonic.gif).
