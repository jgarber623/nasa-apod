Yesterday, the [Moon was New](https://moon.nasa.gov/moon-in-motion/phases-eclipses-supermoons/moon-phases/). But on January 9, early morning risers around planet Earth were treated to the sight of an old Moon, low in the east as the sky grew [bright before dawn](https://poets.org/poem/nothing-gold-can-stay). Above the city of Saarburg in Rhineland-Palatinate, western Germany, this simple snapshot found the waning Moon's [sunlit crescent](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181110.html) just before sunrise. But also never wandering far from the Sun [in Earth's sky](https://plus.nasa.gov/video/whats-up-january-2024-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/), inner planets Venus and Mercury shared the [cold morning skyview](https://twanight.org/gallery/a-heavenly-triangle-over-saarburg/). In the foreground are the historic city's tower and castle with ruins from the 10th century.
