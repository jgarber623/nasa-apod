The star system GK Per is known to be associated with only two of the three nebulas [pictured](https://www.astrobin.com/ocm8rv/). At 1500 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) distant, Nova Persei 1901 ([GK Persei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GK_Persei)) was the second closest [nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova) yet recorded. At the very center is a [white dwarf star](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/types/#white-dwarfs), the surviving core of a former Sun-like star. It is surrounded by the circular [Firework nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap980704.html), gas that was ejected by a [thermonuclear explosion](https://youtu.be/11e8XyUBqRQ) on the white dwarf's surface -- a nova -- as [recorded in 1901](https://www.aavso.org/vsots_gkper). The red glowing gas surrounding the Firework nebula is the atmosphere that used to surround the central star. This gas was expelled before the [nova](https://youtu.be/zYmd8EETy74) and appears as a diffuse [planetary nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230416.html). The [faint gray gas](https://deepskycollective.com/gkpersei/lrgbhoo) running across is [interstellar cirrus](https://www.cosmotography.com/images/galactic_cirrus.html) that seems to be [just passing through](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10332) coincidently. In 1901, GK Per's nova [became brighter](https://media.zenfs.com/en_US/News/BGR_News/scared-surprised-cat-face.jpg) than [Betelgeuse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200511.html). Similarly, star system [T CrB](https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/2024/02/27/view-nova-explosion-new-star-in-northern-crown/) is expected to erupt in a nova later this year, but we don't know exactly when nor [how bright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Coronae_Borealis) it will become.
