Where are all of these meteors coming from? In terms of direction on the sky, the pointed answer is the [constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation)) of Gemini. That is why the major meteor shower in December is known as the [Geminids](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/geminids/) -- because shower meteors all appear to come from a [radiant toward Gemini](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221225.html). Three dimensionally, however, [sand-sized debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteors) expelled from the unusual asteroid [3200 Phaethon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3200_Phaethon) follows a well-defined orbit about our Sun, and the part of the orbit that approaches [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) is superposed in front of the [constellation of Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation)). Therefore, when Earth [crosses this orbit](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180808.html), the [radiant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_(meteor_shower)) point of [falling](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210815.html) debris appears in Gemini. Featured here is a composite of [many](https://live.staticflickr.com/5613/15634745431_af629b9374.jpg) images taken a few days ago through dark skies from [Nianhu Lake](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/photos/202011/23/content_WS5fbb23bcc6d0f72576940628.html) in [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China). Over 100 [bright meteor](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap081125.html) streaks from the [Geminids meteor shower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminids) are visible.
