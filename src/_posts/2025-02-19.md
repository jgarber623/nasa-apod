How do stars and planets form? New clues have been found in the protoplanetary system [Herbig-Haro 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HH_30) by the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/) in concert with [Hubble](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090525.html) and the Earth-bound [ALMA](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/alma/#what-is-alma). The [observations show](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...980...49T/abstract), among other things, that large [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html) grains are more concentrated into a central disk where they can form planets. The [featured image](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/02/HH_30_MIRI_NIRCam_image) from Webb shows many attributes of the active HH-30 system. [Jets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230919.html) of particles are being expelled vertically, shown in red, while a dark [dust-rich disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230511.html) is seen across the center, blocking the light from the star or stars still forming there. Blue-reflecting dust is seen in a [parabolic arc](https://www.geogebra.org/m/yT5YjWDt) above and below the central disk, although why a tail appears on the lower left is currently unknown. [Studying](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2FdNVVXSoLqNrWLIwCdFQXnh64EN06q51x5PgWyVK0aO0.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D7c1f6961b485f508f309e0dc4415455e02564ca6) how planets form in [HH 30](https://esawebb.org/images/potm2501b/) can help astronomers better understand how planets in our own [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/solar-system-facts/) once formed, including [our Earth](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/collection/1461/astronaut-photography).
