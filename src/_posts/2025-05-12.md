What does our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) look like from the side? Because we are on the inside, humanity can’t get an actual picture. Recently, however, just such a map has been made using location data for over a billion stars from ESA’s [Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_\(spacecraft\)) mission. The resulting [featured illustration](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/01/The_best_Milky_Way_map_by_Gaia_edge-on) shows that just like [many](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240606.html) [other](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220423.html) [spiral](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170112.html) [galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141105.html), our Milky Way has a very thin central disk. [Our Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) and all the stars we see at night are in this disk. Although [hypothesized before](https://www.science.org/content/article/milky-way-more-warped-astronomers-thought), perhaps [more surprising](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/comments/1cfcrpk/my_dog_is_very_surprised/#lightbox) is that the disk appears curved at the outer edges. The colors of our Galaxy's [warped](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120304.html) central band derive mostly from dark [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100322.html), [bright blue stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241209.html), and [red emission nebulas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241104.html). Although data analysis is ongoing, [Gaia was deactivated](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Operations/Farewell_Gaia!_Spacecraft_operations_come_to_an_end) in March after a successful mission.
