It was the first time ever. At least, the first time this photographer had ever seen aurora from his home mountains. And what a [spectacular aurora](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240512.html) it was. The [Karkonosze Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Mountains_National_Park) in [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland) are usually too far south to see any auroras. But on the [amazing night](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-scottish-fold-cat-head-260nw-1277698591.jpg) of May 10 - 11, purple and green colors lit up much of the night sky, a surprising spectacle that [also appeared over many](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.431368006258449&type=3) mid-[latitude](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Biagio-Di-Mauro-2/publication/355674389/figure/fig1/AS:1084113742245888@1635484266211/Global-map-divided-in-tropical-areas-middle-latitudes-and-polar-regions.png) locations around the [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html). The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/C60r4UgLlGq/) is a composite of six vertical exposures taken during the auroral peak. The futuristic buildings on the right are part of a [meteorological observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadeusz_Ho%C5%82dys_High-Mountain_Meteorological_Observatory_on_%C5%9Anie%C5%BCka) located on the highest peak of the [Karkonosze Mountains](https://youtu.be/BiNQB4f_6eY). The [purple color](https://site.uit.no/spaceweather/wp-content/uploads/sites/194/2019/08/Colours-700x742.png) is primarily due to [Sun-triggered](https://theconversation.com/are-the-northern-lights-caused-by-particles-from-the-sun-not-exactly-174019), high-energy [electrons](https://www.aps.org/archives/publications/apsnews/200010/history.cfm) impacting [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen) molecules in [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-earths-atmosphere/). Our [Sun](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-the-sun/) is reaching its maximum [surface activity](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/solar-cycle-25-is-here-nasa-noaa-scientists-explain-what-that-means/) over the next two years, and although many more [auroras](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230122.html) are predicted, most will occur over regions closer to the [Earth's poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_regions_of_Earth).
