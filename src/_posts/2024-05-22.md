It was bright and green and stretched across the sky. This striking aurora display was captured in 2016 just outside of [Östersund](https://youtu.be/E0z1BqhtyLA), [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden). Six photographic fields were merged to create the featured panorama spanning almost 180 degrees. Particularly striking aspects of this [aurora](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/) include its sweeping arc-like shape and its stark definition. [Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storsj%C3%B6n) [Storsjön](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KqryCRpT_s) is seen in the foreground, while several familiar constellations and the star [Polaris](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150602.html) are visible through the aurora, far in the background. Coincidently, the [aurora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMfUVfjHnKc) appears to [avoid](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-11/18/19/asset/fa34aa54b531/sub-buzz-8699-1574104451-1.jpg) the Moon visible on the lower left. The aurora appeared a [day after](https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&day=12&month=04&year=2016) a [large hole](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/feature3.shtml) opened in the [Sun's corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170920.html), allowing particularly energetic particles to flow out into the [Solar System](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190520.html). The [green color of the aurora](https://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/4D.html) is caused by [oxygen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml) atoms recombining with ambient [electrons](https://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whelect.html) high in the [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/earths-atmospheric-layers-3/).
