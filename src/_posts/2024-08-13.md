What's that on the horizon? When circling the Earth on the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/) early [last month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Crew-8), astronaut [Matthew Dominick](https://www.nasa.gov/people/matthew-dominick/) saw an unusual type of lightning just beyond the Earth's edge: a gigantic jet. The powerful jet appears on the left of the [featured image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/semeion/53899529103/in/pool-apods/) in red and blue. [Giant jet lightning](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160823.html) has only been known about for the past 23 years. The atmospheric jets are associated with thunderstorms and extend upwards towards [Earth's ionosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/10-things-to-know-about-the-ionosphere/). The lower part of [the frame](https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/SearchPhotos/photo.pl?mission=ISS071&roll=E&frame=319414) shows the [Earth at night](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121207.html), with Earth's thin atmosphere tinted green from airglow. [City lights](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130331.html) are visible, sometimes resolved, but usually creating diffuse white glows in intervening clouds. The top of [the frame](https://www.flickr.com/photos/frankie57pr/53877835585/) reveals distant stars in the dark night sky. The nature of [gigantic jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper-atmospheric_lightning#Gigantic_jets) and their possible association with other types of [Transient Luminous Events](https://skybrary.aero/articles/transient-luminous-events-tles) (TLEs) such as [blue jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper-atmospheric_lightning#Blue_jets) and [red sprites](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231002.html) remains an [active topic of research](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Example-dog-on-the-internet.png).
