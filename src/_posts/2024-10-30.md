What created this huge space bubble? Blown by the wind from a star, this [tantalizing](http://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/bubbles/bubbles.html), head-like apparition is cataloged as NGC 7635, but known simply as the [Bubble Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Nebula). The featured striking view utilizes a long exposure to reveal the intricate details of [this cosmic bubble](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030617.html) and its environment. Although it looks delicate, the 10 [light-year](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) diameter bubble offers evidence of [violent processes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240109.html) at work. Seen here above and right of [the Bubble](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170531.html)'s center, a bright hot star is embedded in the nebula's [reflecting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_nebula) dust. A fierce [stellar wind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind) and intense radiation from the [star](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/), which likely has a mass 10 to 20 times that of the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/), has blasted out the [structure of glowing gas](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995A%26A...295..509C/abstract) against denser material in a surrounding [molecular cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html). The intriguing [Bubble Nebula](https://science.nasa.gov/image-detail/37893980612-307324af83-o/) lies a mere 11,000 [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/)s away toward the [boastful](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/159176199/photo/cat.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=U34AGa5EN0xuBbrzpSygVHcR7RHuwWAivyH7hpHw_m0=) constellation [Cassiopeia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_%28constellation%29).
