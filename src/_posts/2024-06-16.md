What happens if a star gets too close to a black hole? The [black hole](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/) can rip it apart -- but how? It's not the high gravitational attraction itself that's the problem -- it's the [difference in gravitational pull](http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/Gravity/tides.html) across the star that creates the destruction. In the [featured animated video](https://www.desy.de/news/news_search/index_eng.html?openDirectAnchor=2030) illustrating this disintegration, you first see a star approaching the black hole. Increasing in orbital speed, the [star's outer atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_atmosphere) is ripped away during closest approach. Much of the star's atmosphere disperses into deep space, but some continues to orbit the black hole and forms an [accretion disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170327.html). The [animation](https://youtu.be/ubBzcSD8G8k) then takes you into the accretion disk while looking toward the black hole. Including the [strange visual effects](https://www.phy.mtu.edu/bht/rjn_bht.html) of [gravitational lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens), you can even [see the far side of the disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240508.html). Finally, you [look along](https://previews.123rf.com/images/natara/natara1807/natara180700046/106000297-cat-looking-on-the-table-in-the-coffee-shop.jpg) one of the [jet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240509.html)s being expelled along the spin axis. Theoretical [models indicate](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs.tmp...49W/abstract) that these jets not only expel energetic gas, but also create energetic [neutrinos](https://nasa.tumblr.com/post/643837966463188992/youre-always-surrounded-by-neutrinos) -- one of which may have been [seen recently](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2268724-weve-spotted-a-neutrino-blasted-out-by-a-black-hole-shredding-a-star/) on [Earth](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/topic/image-of-the-day).
