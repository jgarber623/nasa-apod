If one black hole looks strange, what about two? Light rays from accretion disks around a pair of orbiting [supermassive black holes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100529.html) make their way through the warped space-time produced by extreme gravity in [this detailed computer visualization](https://www.nasa.gov/universe/new-nasa-visualization-probes-the-light-bending-dance-of-binary-black-holes/). The [simulated accretion disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200825.html)s have been given different [false color](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/1247cvr/im_a_dog_groomer_and_my_sister_left_me_with_her/#lightbox) schemes, red for the disk surrounding a 200-million-solar-mass black hole, and blue for the disk surrounding a 100-million-solar-mass [black hole](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/). For these masses, though, both [accretion disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk)s would [actually emit](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190411.html) most of their light in the [ultraviolet](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/). The [video](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/14132/) allows us to see [both sides](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993AmJPh..61..619N/abstract) of each black hole at the same time. Red and blue light originating from both [black holes can be seen](https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html) in the innermost ring of light, called the [photon sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere), near their event horizons. In the past decade, [gravitational wave](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/gravitational-waves/)s from black hole collisions have actually [been detected](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201104.html), although the [coalescence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210411.html) of supermassive black holes remains undiscovered.
