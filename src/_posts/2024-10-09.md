What's happening at the center of spiral galaxy M106? A swirling disk of stars and gas, [M106](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_106)'s appearance is dominated by blue spiral arms and red [dust](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.astro.41.011802.094840) lanes near the nucleus, as shown in the [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/w20wbw/0/) taken from the [Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait)i [desert](https://youtu.be/D7NEE32wics). The core of [M106](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131003.html) glows brightly in [radio waves](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves) and [X-rays](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays/) where [twin jets have been found](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...440..181C/abstract) running the length of the galaxy. An unusual central glow makes [M106](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140705.html) one of the closest examples of the [Seyfert class of galaxies](http://www.seyfertgalaxies.com/), where vast amounts of glowing gas are thought to be falling into a central massive [black hole](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/ask_astro/black_holes.html). [M](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000311.html)106, also designated [NGC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_General_Catalogue) 4258, is a relatively close 23.5 million light years away, spans 60 thousand [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) across, and can be [seen with a small telescope](https://skywiseunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/scoper_05.jpg) towards the [constellation](https://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations/) of the Hunting Dogs ([Canes Venatici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canes_Venatici)).
