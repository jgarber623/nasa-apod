Yes, but can your blizzard do this? In the [Upper Peninsula of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan)'s Storm of the Century in 1938, some snow drifts reached the level of [utility poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_pole). Nearly a meter of new and unexpected [snow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240106.html) fell over two days in a storm that started 86 years ago this week. As [snow fell and gale-force winds](http://books.google.com/books?id=1vioLQGvvz8C&pg=PA156&dq=%2B%221938%22+storm+of+the+century&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1breUorcC-O52QWuqYGwAQ&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%2B%221938%22%20storm%20of%20the%20century&f=false) piled snow to [surreal heights](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blizzard2_-_NOAA.jpg), many roads became not only impassable but unplowable; people became stranded, cars, school buses and a train became mired, and even a [dangerous fire raged](https://tylerrtichelaar.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/marquettes-opera-house-the-1938-fire-and-blizzard/). Two people were killed and some [student](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b1/c8/e3/b1c8e3101db30b200cec55976b9ec648--funniest-animals-funny-animals.jpg)s were forced to spend several consecutive days at school. The [featured image](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1401/snowpoles_brinkman_2592.jpg) was taken by a local resident soon after the [storm](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/topic/severe-storms). Although all of this [snow eventually melted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pApFztL-lsI), repeated snow storms like this help build lasting [glaciers](http://extremeicesurvey.org/how-does-a-glacies-form/) in snowy regions of our [planet Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100713.html).
