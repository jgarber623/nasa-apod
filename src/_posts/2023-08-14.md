The [Ring Nebula (M57)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_nebula), is more complicated than it appears through a small telescope. The easily visible [central ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210815.html) is about one [light-year](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) across, but this remarkable exposure by the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://webb.nasa.gov/content/about/index.html) explores this [popular nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/undefined) with a [deep exposure](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210818.html) in [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves). Strings of gas, like eyelashes around a cosmic eye, [become evident](https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/image/ssc2005-07a-ring-beholds-a-delicate-flower) around the Ring in this digitally enhanced featured image in assigned colors. These long filaments [may be caused by shadowing](https://youtu.be/6FSIfUYFeTM?t=60s) of knots of dense gas in the ring from energetic light emitted within. The Ring Nebula is an elongated [planetary nebula](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/p/Planetary+Nebulae), a type of gas cloud created when a [Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230611.html)\-like star evolves to [throw off its outer atmosphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FSIfUYFeTM) to become a [white dwarf star](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/dwarfs2.html). The central oval in the [Ring Nebula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiYRL3HFULU) lies about 2,500 light-years away toward the musical [constellation Lyra](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/lyr/index.html).
