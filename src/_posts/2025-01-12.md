Whatever hit Mimas nearly destroyed it. What remains is one of the [largest impact craters](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960906.html) on one of [Saturn](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/)'s smallest round moons. [Analysis indicates](https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/mimas-saturns-moon/) that a slightly larger impact would have destroyed [Mimas](https://trek.nasa.gov/mimas/) entirely. The huge crater, named [Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herschel_Space_Observatory) after the 1789 discoverer of Mimas, [Sir William Herschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel), spans about 130 kilometers and is [featured here](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12570). [Mimas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimas_\(moon\))' low mass produces a [surface gravity](https://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/weight/) just strong enough to create a [spherical body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_star) but weak enough to allow such [relatively large](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/jhqiig/fluffy_norwegian_forest_cat/#lightbox) surface features. [Mimas](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/moons/mimas/) is made of mostly water ice with a smattering of rock - so it is accurately described as a big dirty snowball. The [featured image](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12570) was taken during the closest-ever flyby of the [robot spacecraft Cassini](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/spacecraft/cassini-orbiter/) past Mimas in 2010 while in orbit [around Saturn](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200419.html).
