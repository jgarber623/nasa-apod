[This spectacular](https://www.astrobin.com/huresx/) intergalactic skyscape features Arp 227, a curious system of galaxies from the 1966 [Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/Arp_contents.html). Some 100 million light-years distant within the boundaries of the constellation Pisces, Arp 227 consists of the two galaxies prominent above and left of center, the [shell galaxy NGC 474](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180206.html) and its blue, spiral-armed neighbor NGC 470. The readily apparent shells and star streams of [NGC 474 are likely tidal features](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...660A..28B/abstract) originating from the accretion of another smaller galaxy during close gravitational encounters that began over a billion years ago. The large galaxy on the bottom righthand side of the deep image, NGC 467, appears to be surrounded by faint shells and streams too, evidence of another [merging galaxy system](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30955). Intriguing background galaxies are scattered around the field that also includes spiky foreground stars. Of course, those stars lie well within our own [Milky Way Galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080104.html). The telescopic field of view spans 25 arc minutes or just under 1/2 degree [on the sky](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/scale.html).
