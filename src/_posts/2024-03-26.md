Comet Pons-Brooks has quite a tail to tell. [First discovered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12P/Pons%E2%80%93Brooks#Observational_history) in [1385](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1385), this erupting [dirty snowball](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/facts/) loops back into our inner [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/facts/) every 71 years and, this time, is starting to [put on a show](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YXmt_QrqXUE/maxresdefault.jpg) for deep camera exposures. In the [featured picture](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamespeirce/53600572168/in/pool-apods/), the light blue stream is the [ion tail](http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/SolarSys/Comets/tails.html) which consists of charged [molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule)s pushed away from the comet's nucleus by the solar wind. The ion tail, shaped by the [Sun's wind](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000318.html) and the [comet's core's rotation](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240318.html), always points away from the Sun. [Comet 12P/Ponsâ€“Brooks](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240216.html) is now [visible](https://theskylive.com/where-is-12p) with binoculars in the early evening sky toward the northwest, moving perceptibly from night to night. The frequently flaring comet is expected to continue to brighten, on the average, and [may even become visible](https://theskylive.com/12p-info) with the unaided eye -- _during the day_ \-- to those in the [path of totality](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5219/) of the coming [solar eclipse on April 8](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/).
