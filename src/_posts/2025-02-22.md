Rima Hyginus is a [spectacular fissure](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasa2explore/9349493673), some 220 kilometers long, found near the center of the [lunar near side](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/lunar-near-side-2/). Easy to spot in telescopic views of the Moon, it stretches top left to bottom right across this [lunar closeup](https://telescopius.com/spa/pictures/view/215248/moon/rima-hyginus-lrgb/by-vincenzo-mirabella?gallery_user_id=37672&gallery_order=is_featured&gallery_order_asc=false&gallery_page=1). The image was made with [exaggerated colors](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171111.html) that reflect the mineral composition of the lunar soil. [Hyginus crater](http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/images/542) lies near the center of the narrow lunar surface groove. About 10 kilometers in diameter, the low-walled crater is a volcanic caldera, one of the larger non-impact craters on the lunar surface. Dotted with small pits formed by surface collapse, Hyginus rima itself was likely created by stresses due to internal [magma upwelling](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011Icar..215..584W/abstract) and collapse along a long surface fault. The intriguing region was a candidate landing site for the canceled Apollo 19 mission.
