Sometimes, the Moon visits the Pleiades. Technically, this means that the orbit of [our Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/) takes it directly in front of the famous [Pleiades star cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241209.html), which is far in the distance. The technical term for the event is an [occultation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation), and the Moon is famous for its rare occultations [of](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200621.html) [all](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190409.html) [planets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250115.html) and several well-known [bright star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170505.html)s. The Moon's tilted and [precessing orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_precession) makes its occultations of the [Seven Sisters star cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240929.html) bunchy, with the current epoch [starting in 2023](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/observing-news/watch-the-moon-occult-the-pleiades-spica-too/) continuing monthly until 2029. After that, though, the next occultation [won't occur](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Flonely-sad-cat-v0-gbl9nva813ne1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D79d816671a1bb09699263c4c3e83ba9f5df9f133) until 2042. Taken from [Cantabria](https://youtu.be/LH3qwMH22bo), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) on April 1, the [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DH_ptItogQl/) is a composite where previous exposures of the Pleiades from the same camera and location were digitally added to the last image to bring up the star cluster's [iconic blue glow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210406.html).
