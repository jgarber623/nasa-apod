Right now, one of the largest sunspot groups in recent history is crossing the Sun. [Active Region 3664](https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/news/view/531/20240508-sunspot-region-3664-major-flares-and-cmes.html) is not only big -- it's violent, throwing off clouds of particles into the [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/). Some of these [CME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection)s are already impacting the Earth, and others might follow. At the extreme, [these solar storms](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/geomagnetic-storming-likely-persist-weekend) could cause some [Earth-orbiting satellites to malfunction](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5214/), the [Earth's atmosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/) to slightly distort, and [electrical power grids to surge](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/images/u33/finalBoulderPresentation042611%20%281%29.pdf). When impacting [Earth's upper atmosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-atmosphere/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/), these particles can produce beautiful auroras, with some [auroras](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230122.html) already being reported [unusually far south](https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=206722). Pictured here, [AR3664](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/large-and-complex-sunspot-groups-lead-increased-solar-flare-chances) and its dark [sunspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot)s were captured yesterday in visible light from [Rome](https://youtu.be/oSexfR0Ubzw), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). The AR3664 sunspot group is so large that it is [visible just with glasses](https://people.com/thmb/kiAUaJce7MqVr5XwZFuOA3S10MU=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2):format(webp)/dog-eclipse-2000-ef0176770ff64e6b913f2af6e8273a24.jpg) designed to [view](https://earthsky.org/sun/giant-sunspot-region-ar3664-visible-in-eclipse-glasses/) last month's [total solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/). This weekend, [skygazing enthusiasts](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040808.html) will be keenly watching the night skies all over the globe for [bright](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240114.html) and [unusual auroras](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150601.html).
