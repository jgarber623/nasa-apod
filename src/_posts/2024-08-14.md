This was an unusual night. For one thing, the night sky of August 11 and 12, earlier this week, occurred near the peak of the annual [Perseid Meteor Shower](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/perseids/). Therefore, meteors streaked across the dark night as small bits cast off from [Comet Swift-Tuttle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960219.html) came crashing into the [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-earths-atmosphere/). Even more unusually, for central [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) at least, the night [sky glowed purple](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240612.html). The red-blue hue was due to aurora caused by an [explosion of particles](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180902.html) from the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) a few days before. [This auroral storm](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/severe-g4-geomagnetic-storms-observed-12-aug-2024) was so intense that it was seen as far south as [Texas](https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=211318) and [Italy](https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=211357), in Earth's northern hemisphere. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-k4uM-NtSP/) composite was built from 7 exposures taken over 26 minutes from [Ense](https://youtu.be/7SylqzpjQfA), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany). The Perseids occur [predictably](https://mrwallpaper.com/images/high/cute-yet-bored-funny-cat-e2ftbgrfxrbazqsb.webp) every August, but auroras visible this far south are more unusual and less predictable.
