If not perfect, then this [spiral galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy) is at least one of the most photogenic. An [island universe](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March02/Gordon/Gordon2.html) containing billions of stars and situated about 40 million light-years away toward the constellation of the Dolphinfish ([Dorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorado)), [NGC 1566 presents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1566) a gorgeous [face-on view](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010427.html). Classified as a [grand design](http://burro.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr222/Galaxies/Spiral/spiral.html) spiral, NGC 1566 shows two prominent and graceful spiral arms that are traced by bright [blue star clusters](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200909.html) and dark [cosmic dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151119.html) lanes. Numerous [Hubble Space Telescope](https://hubblesite.org/) images of [NGC 1566](https://esahubble.org/images/potw1422a/) have been taken to study [star formation](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve), [supernovas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8en5uDqw0aM), and the spiral's [unusually active](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1184409133/photo/happy-dog-making-mess-with-papers-on-bed.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=HIvJz4ifaBEf3DWHBip9y7tWjdajJHbEnu3hBWlkYis=) center. Some of these images, stored online in the [Hubble Legacy Archive](https://hla.stsci.edu/), were freely downloaded, combined, and digitally processed by an [industrious amateur](https://www.flickr.com/photos/76780020@N07/) to create the featured image. [NGC 1566's flaring center](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483L..88P/abstract) makes the spiral one of the closest and brightest [Seyfert galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seyfert_galaxy), likely housing a central [supermassive black hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181203.html) wreaking havoc on [surrounding stars and gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190427.html).
