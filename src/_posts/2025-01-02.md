Recorded during 2024, this year-spanning series of images [reveals a pattern](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241204.html) in the seasonal drift of the Sun's daily motion through planet Earth's sky. Known to some as [an analemma](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013arXiv1302.0765H/abstract), the figure-eight curve was captured in exposures taken only at 1pm local time on clear days from Kayseri, Turkiye. Of course the Sun's position on the 2024 [solstice](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241221.html) dates was at the top and bottom of the curve. They correspond to the astronomical beginning of summer and winter in the north. The points along the curve [half-way between](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma#/media/File:Analemma_Earth.png) the solstices, but not the figure-eight curve crossing point, mark the 2024 [equinoxes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190320.html) and the start of spring and fall. Regional peaks and dormant volcano Mount Erciyes lie along the southern horizon in the [2024 timelapse skyscape](https://www.instagram.com/betul_turksoy/p/DEDL4R6iA3_/?img_index=1).
