The [Great Nebula in Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula), an immense, nearby [starbirth region](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/stellar_nurseries.html), is probably the most famous of all [astronomical nebulas](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&authuser=0&site=imghp&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1071&bih=646&q=site%3Aapod.nasa.gov+nebula&oq=site%3Aapod.nasa.gov+nebula). Here, [glowing gas](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/E/Emission+Nebula) surrounds hot young stars at the edge of an [immense](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101023.html) interstellar [molecular cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html) only 1500 [light-years](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) away. In the [featured deep image](https://fenyeslorand.hu/orion/) in [assigned colors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRGB) highlighted by emission in [oxygen](http://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml) and [hydrogen](http://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml), wisps and sheets of [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990509.html) and gas are particularly evident. The [Great Nebula in Orion](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151104.html) can be found with the [unaided eye](https://c.tenor.com/JhvJXq30yA4AAAAC/tenor.gif) near the [easily identifiable](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap081015.html) belt of three stars in the popular [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/) [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_%28constellation%29). In addition to housing a bright [open cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/open_clusters.html) of stars known as the [Trapezium](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180805.html), the [Orion Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130213.html) contains many [stellar nurseries](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/). These nurseries contain much [hydrogen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMB2VR0087w) gas, hot young stars, [proplyds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap961017.html), and [stellar jets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130324.html) spewing material at high speeds. Also known as [M42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w8wwUqC4Xc), the [Orion Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap980421.html) spans about 40 [light years](http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html) and is located in the same [spiral arm](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080606.html) of [our Galaxy](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html) as the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/).
