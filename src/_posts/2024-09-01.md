Why does Saturn appear so big? It doesn't -- what is pictured are foreground clouds on [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) crossing in front of the [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/facts/). The Moon shows a slight crescent phase with most of its surface visible by reflected [Earthlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthlight_\(astronomy\)), known as [Da Vinci glow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190504.html). The [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/facts/) directly illuminates the brightly lit [lunar crescent](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230527.html) from the bottom, which means that the Sun must be below the horizon and so the image was taken before sunrise. This [double take](http://img.over-blog.com/600x450/0/19/24/98/optical-illusion/kit-cat.jpg)\-inducing picture was captured on 2019 December 24, two days before the Moon slid in front of the [Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191028.html) to create a [solar eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191228.html). In the foreground, lights from small [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala)n towns are visible behind the huge [volcano Pacaya](https://youtu.be/9fqNNALIWjQ).
