Can a rocket make the Moon ripple? No, but it can make a background moon appear [wavy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110824.html). The rocket, in this case, was a [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX) [Falcon Heavy](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-heavy/) that blasted off from [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s [Kennedy Space Center](https://www.nasa.gov/kennedy/) last week. In the [featured launch picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1axBjiML5G/), the rocket's exhaust plume glows beyond its projection onto the distant, rising, and nearly full moon. Oddly, the Moon's lower edge shows [unusual drip-like ripples](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220531.html). The [Moon itself](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/), far in the distance, was really unchanged. The [physical cause](https://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/local/2016/05/19/why-do-we-see-waves-hot-objects/84598570/) of these [apparent ripples](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221014.html) was pockets of relatively hot or rarefied air [deflecting moonlight](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-causes-a-mirage/) less strongly than pockets of relatively cool or compressed air: [refraction](https://youtu.be/m9cUy6B--xc). Although the [shot was planned](https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/05/71/90/95/1000_F_571909511_2H2RjYDbjosmoIBPivtXCgf61mub22oS.jpg), the timing of [the launch](https://youtu.be/yWUU1PqX6Og?t=50) had to be just right for the rocket to be [transiting the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201106.html) during this single exposure.
