Heading for its next perihelion passage on April 21, [Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12P/Pons%E2%80%93Brooks) is growing brighter. The greenish coma of this periodic Halley-type comet has become relatively easy to observe in small telescopes. But the [bluish ion tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230109.html) now streaming from the active comet's coma and buffeted by the solar wind, is faint and difficult to follow. Still, [in this image](https://www.astrobin.com/3wdu89/B/) stacked exposures made on the night of February 11 reveal the fainter tail's detailed structures. The frame spans over two degrees across a background of faint stars and background galaxies toward the northern constellation Lacerta. [Of course](https://www.universetoday.com/165447/the-comet-vs-the-eclipse-12p-pons-brooks-heads-towards-perihelion-in-april/) Comet 12P's April 21 perihelion passage will be only two weeks after the April 8 total solar eclipse, putting the comet in planet Earth's sky along with a [totally eclipsed Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/).
