What can a space rock tell us about life on Earth? [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s [OSIRIS-REx spacecraft](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/osiris-rex/) [made a careful approach](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201012.html) to the near-Earth asteroid [101955 Bennu](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/101955-bennu/) in [October of 2020](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201022.html) to collect surface samples. In September 2023, the robotic spaceship [returned these samples to Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230929.html). A recent [analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08495-6) has [shown](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02472-9), surprisingly, that the samples contained 14 out of the 20 known [amino acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid)s that are the essential building blocks of life. The presence of the amino acids re-introduces a big question: Could life have originated in space? However, the protein building blocks themselves held another surprise -- [they contained](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-asteroid-bennu-sample-reveals-mix-of-lifes-ingredients/) an even mixture of [left-handed and right-handed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality) amino acids -- in contrast to our Earth which only has left-handed ones. This raises another big question: [Why](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/how-life-turned-left/) does life on Earth have only left-handed amino acids? Research on this is [sure to continue](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/fd55vk/my_kitten_is_helping_me_work_from_home_i_had_to/#lightbox).
