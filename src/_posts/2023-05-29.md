What glows there? The answer depends: sea or sky? In the sea, the unusual blue glow is [bioluminescence](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/fish/bioluminescence). Specifically, the glimmer arises from [Noctiluca scintillans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctiluca_scintillans), single-celled plankton stimulated by the lapping waves. The [plankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton) use their glow to [startle and illuminate](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2040076/startled-cat-looks-camera.jpg?w=790&f=eead42729d60aeb4993404f1cdd17f5a) predators. This mid-February display on an island in the [Maldives](https://youtu.be/hCQvPX0DLFM) was so intense that the astrophotographer described it as a [turquoise wonderland](https://www.petrhoralek.com/?p=23528). In the sky, by contrast, are the more familiar glows of [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve) and [nebula](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/nebula/en/)s. The white band rising from the artificially-illuminated [green plants](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-are-plants-green-to-reduce-the-noise-in-photosynthesis-20200730/) is created by billions of stars in the central disk of our [Milky Way Galaxy](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html). Also visible in the sky is the star cluster [Omega Centauri](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230316.html), toward the left, and the famous [Southern Cross](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210125.html) [asterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy)) in the center. Red-glowing nebulas include the bright [Carina Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220425.html), just right of center, and the expansive [Gum Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221129.html) on the upper right.
