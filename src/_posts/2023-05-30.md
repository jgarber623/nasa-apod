Is this what will become of our Sun? Quite possibly. The first hint of our [Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/)'s future was discovered inadvertently in [1764](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1764). At that time, [Charles Messier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Messier) was compiling a list of diffuse objects not to be confused with comets. The 27th object on [Messier's list](http://www.seasky.org/astronomy/astronomy-messier.html), now known as [M27](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080626.html) or the Dumbbell Nebula, is a [planetary nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/planetary_nebulae.html), one of the brightest [planetary nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula) on the sky and visible with binoculars toward the [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/en/) of the Fox ([Vulpecula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulpecula)). It takes light about 1000 years to reach us from M27, [featured here](https://cosgrovescosmos.com/projects/m27-the-dumbbell-nebula-reprocess) in [colors](https://www.startools.org/modules/composite/usage/popular-coloring) emitted by [sulfur](https://youtu.be/mddfu3TXaRw) (red), [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha) (green) and [oxygen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml) (blue). We now know that in about 6 billion years, [our Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180926.html) will [shed its outer gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#After_core_hydrogen_exhaustion) into a [planetary nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula#Morphology) like M27, while its remaining center will become an [X-ray](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays) hot [white dwarf](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000910.html) star. Understanding the physics and significance of [M27](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100826.html) was well beyond 18th century science, though. Even today, many things [remain mysterious](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/70/ce/c3/70cec30919aefe50ada3bd8e0e6239e6.jpg) about [planetary nebulas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230416.html), including [how](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula#Current_issues_in_planetary_nebula_studies) their [intricate](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210425.html) [shapes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200721.html) are created.
