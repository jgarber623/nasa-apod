On July 4, an almost Full Moon rose [in planet Earth's](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/) evening skies. Also known as a Buck Moon, the full lunar phase ([full on July 3](https://earthsky.org/sky-archive/july-full-moon/) at 11:39 UTC) was near perigee, the closest point in the Moon's [almost monthly orbit](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221001.html) around planet Earth. [That qualified](http://astropixels.com/ephemeris/moon/fullperigee2001.html) this July's Full Moon as a supermoon, the first of [four supermoons in 2023](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/what-is-a-supermoon/). Seen from Cocoa Beach along Florida's [Space Coast](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200731.html) on July 4, any big, bright, beautiful Full Moon would still have to compete for attention though. July's super-moonrise was captured here against a super-colorful fireworks display.
