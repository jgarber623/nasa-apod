Why is Polaris called the North Star? First, [Polaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris) is the nearest [bright star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221218.html) toward the north [spin axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Planets_and_dwarf_planets%27_tilt_and_rotation_speed.webm) of the Earth. Therefore, as the [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) turns, stars appear to revolve around [Polaris](https://youtu.be/cDhSSxmk3PQ), but Polaris itself always stays in the same northerly direction -- making it the [North Star](https://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/polaris-the-present-day-north-star). Since no bright star is near the [south spin axis](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210101.html) of the Earth, there is currently [no bright South Star](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/6284/is-there-a-south-star). Thousands of years ago, Earth's spin axis pointed in a slightly different direction so that [Vega was the North Star](https://www.space.com/21719-vega.html). Although [Polaris](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150602.html) is [not](https://meowconnectioncom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/296622-bigthumbnail.jpg) the brightest star on the sky, it is easily located because it is [nearly aligned with two stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201116.html) in the cup of the [Big Dipper](https://earthsky.org/favorite-star-patterns/big-and-little-dippers-highlight-northern-sky). [Polaris](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Ursa_Minor_IAU.svg) is near the center of the five-degree wide featured image, a digital composite of hundreds of exposures that brings out faint gas and dust of the [Integrated Flux Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170627.html) (IFN) all over the frame. The surface of [Cepheid](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/cepheids.html) Polaris slowly [pulsates](https://youtu.be/7ohkKiZTJOg), causing the famous star to [change its brightness](https://youtu.be/q-szkabhXQQ) by a few percent over the course of a few days.
