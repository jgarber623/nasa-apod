What created this unusual celestial firework? The nebula, dubbed [Pa 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1181#Pa_30), appears in the same sky direction now as a bright "[guest star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guest_star_(astronomy))" did in the [year 1181](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1181). Although Pa 30's filaments look similar to that created by a nova (for example [GK Per](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111105.html)), and a planetary nebula (for example [NGC 6751](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130313.html)), some astronomers [now propose](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.523.3885S/abstract) that it was created by a rare type of [supernova](https://youtu.be/-yEBVm5o97E): a thermonuclear Type Iax, and so is (also) named [SN 1181](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1181). In [this model](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acbb67/pdf), the supernova was not the result of the detonation of a single star, but rather a blast that occurred when two [white dwarf stars spiraled together](https://youtu.be/HQtZXjktQ-Q) and merged. The blue dot in the center is hypothesized to be a [zombie star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_star), the remnant white dwarf that [somehow survived](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-scottish-fold-cat-head-600nw-1276621966.jpg) this [supernova](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/)\-level explosion. The [featured image](https://news.umanitoba.ca/ctv-winnipeg-new-image-of-800-year-old-explosion/) combines images and data obtained with [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) ([WISE](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/undefined)), [visible](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) ([MDM](https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/kitt-peak-national-observatory/the-hiltner-24m-telescope/), [Pan-STARRS](https://www2.ifa.hawaii.edu/research/Pan-STARRS.shtml)), and [X-ray](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays/) ([Chandra](https://chandra.harvard.edu/), [XMM](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/XMM-Newton_overview)) telescopes. Future observations and analyses may [tell us more](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230326.html).
