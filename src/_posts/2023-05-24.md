Sometimes we witness the [Moon moving](https://moon.nasa.gov/moon-in-motion/moon-phases/) directly in front of -- called occulting -- one of the planets in our [Solar System](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/). [Earlier this month](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.228700059858579&type=3) that planet was Jupiter. [Captured here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ricoshanchez/52905094949/in/pool-apods/) was the moment when [Jupiter](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/) re-appeared from [behind the surface](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220227.html) of our Moon. The Moon was in its [third quarter](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/lunar-phases-and-eclipses/), two days before the dark [New Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220725.html). Now, our [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) is continuously half lit by the Sun, but when in its third quarter, relatively little of that half can be seen from the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth). Pictured, the Moon itself was aligned behind the famous [Lick Observatory](https://www.lickobservatory.org/) in [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), on the summit of [Mount Hamilton](https://youtu.be/fbU2OUEkasc). [Coincidentally](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d6/dc/8b/d6dc8b1771b697ff2992982482911274.jpg), Lick enabled the discovery of a moon of Jupiter: [Amalthea](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/jupiter-moons/amalthea/in-depth/), the last visually detected moon of Jupiter after [Galileo](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/what-did-galileo-discover)'s [observations](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/307/galileos-observations-of-the-moon-jupiter-venus-and-the-sun/).
