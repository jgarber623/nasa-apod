Have you ever seen the band of our Milky Way Galaxy? In a clear sky from a [dark location](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200408.html) at the right time, a faint band of light becomes visible [across the sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180702.html). Soon after your eyes become [dark adapted](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-eyes-adjust-to-darkness/), you might spot the band for the first time. It may then become obvious. Then [spectacular](https://i.imgur.com/hhZ3FKw.jpeg). One reason for your growing astonishment might be the realization that this fuzzy swath, the [Milky Way](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/), contains billions of stars. Visible in the [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DIg-WT7MmaO/), high above in the night sky, the band of the [Milky Way Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) arcs. Also visible are the colorful clouds of [Rho Ophiuchi](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201014.html) on the right, and the red and circular [Zeta Ophiuchi nebula](https://www.astrobin.com/363646/) near the top center. Taken in late February from [Maunakea](https://youtu.be/FHP5Dusme04), [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), the foreground telescope is the University of Hawaii's [2.2-Meter Telescope](https://www2.ifa.hawaii.edu/88inch/88inch.html). Fortunately, you donâ€™t need to be near the [top of a Hawaiian volcano](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190310.html) to see the Milky Way.
