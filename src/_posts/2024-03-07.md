Not the [James Webb Space Telescope's](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230713.html) latest view of a distant galactic nebula, this cloud of gas and dust dazzled spacecoast skygazers on March 3. The telephoto snapshot was taken minutes after the launch of a Falcon 9 rocket on [the SpaceX Crew-8 mission](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-spacex-crew-8-launches-to-international-space-station/), to the International Space Station. It captures plumes and exhaust from the separated first and second stage, a drifting [Rorschach pattern](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211030.html) in dark evening skies. The bright spot near bottom center within the stunning terrestrial nebulosity is the second stage engine firing to carry 4 [humans to space](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/astronauts/) in the Crew Dragon [spacecraft Endeavour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMSzxmsXXwY). In sharp silhouette just above it is the Falcon 9 first stage booster orienting itself for return to a landing zone [at Cape Canaveral](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230803.html), planet Earth. This reuseable first stage booster was making its first flight. But the [Crew Dragon Endeavour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon_Endeavour) capsule has flown humans to low Earth orbit and back again 4 times before. [Endeavour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Endeavour), as a name for a spacecraft, has also seen reuse, christening retired [Space Shuttle Endeavour](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140831.html) and the [Apollo 15 command module](https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/197685/apollo-15-command-module/).
