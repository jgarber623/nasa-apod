Have you ever seen a dragon in the sky? Although real flying [dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon) don't exist, a huge dragon-shaped aurora developed in the sky over Iceland [in 2019](http://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&day=06&month=02&year=2019). The [aurora](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/) was caused by a [hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100828.html) in the [Sun's corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170920.html) that expelled charged particles into a [solar wind](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000318.html) that followed a changing [interplanetary magnetic field](http://www.spaceweather.com/glossary/imf.html) to [Earth's magnetosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/magnetosphere-ionosphere/). As some of those particles then struck [Earth's atmosphere](https://espo.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/Atmosphere36small.jpg), they [excited atoms](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/atom.html) which subsequently emitted light: aurora. This iconic display was so [enthralling](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2505/4139267083_915e393dbb.jpg) that the photographer's mother ran out to see it and was captured in the foreground. Our [active Sun](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-cycle-progression) continues to show an unusually high number of [prominences](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220216.html), [filaments](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220913.html), [sunspots](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/solar-activity/en/), and [large active regions](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141022.html) as [solar maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum) approaches in 2025.
