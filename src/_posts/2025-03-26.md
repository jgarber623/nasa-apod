You'd think the Pacman Nebula would be eating stars, but actually it is forming them. [Within the nebula](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2007/ngc281/), a cluster's young, massive stars are powering the pervasive nebular glow. The eye-catching shapes looming in the featured portrait of NGC 281 are sculpted dusty columns and dense [Bok globules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bok_globule) seen in silhouette, eroded by intense, energetic winds and [radiation](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) from the hot cluster stars. If they survive long enough, the [dusty structure](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220925.html)s could also be sites of future star formation. [Playfully](https://pethelpful.com/.image/w_828,q_auto:good,c_fill,ar_4:3,g_xy_center,x_564,y_256/NDowMDAwMDAwMDAwMDcwNTY0/catplaypiano-70564-70564-70564-70564-70564-70564-70564.jpg) called the [Pacman](https://doodles.google/doodle/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man/) Nebula because of its overall shape, NGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation [Cassiopeia](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cas/). This [sharp](https://lasi2.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/pin-under-microscope/) composite image was [made](https://www.aaeivissa.com/telescopio-cala-dhort/) through [narrow-band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap071102.html) filters in [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) in mid 2024. It combines emissions from the nebula's hydrogen and oxygen atoms to [synthesize](https://hubblesite.org/contents/articles/the-meaning-of-light-and-color) red, green, and blue colors. The scene spans well over 80 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) at the estimated distance of [NGC 281](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_281).
