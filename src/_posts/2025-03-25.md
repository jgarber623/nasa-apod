What causes a blue band to cross the Moon during a lunar eclipse? The blue band is real but usually quite hard to see. The featured [HDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range) image of last week's lunar eclipse, however -- taken from [Norman](https://youtu.be/l4ep9I3XVog), [Oklahoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma) (USA) -- has been digitally processed to exaggerate [the colors](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220515.html). The gray color on the upper right of the top lunar image is [the Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/facts/)'s natural color, directly illuminated by sunlight. The lower parts of the Moon on all three images are not directly lit by the Sun since it is [being eclipsed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210525.html) -- it is in the [Earth's shadow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211125.html). It is faintly lit, though, by sunlight that has passed deep through [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html). This part of the Moon is red -- and called a [blood Moon](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/blood-moon.html) -- for the same reason that Earth's sunsets are red: because air scatters away [more blue](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/) light than red. The [unusual](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/sf84rb/does_anyone_elses_dog_tilt_their_head_when_they/#lightbox) purple-blue band visible on the upper right of the top and middle images is different -- its color is augmented by sunlight that has passed high through Earth's atmosphere, where [red light](https://earthsky.org/space/why-does-the-moon-look-red-during-a-total-lunar-eclipse/) is better absorbed by [ozone](https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/facts/SH.html) than blue.
