Sometimes, the sky itself seems to smile. A few days ago, visible over much of the world, an unusual superposition of our Moon with the planets [Venus](https://science.nasa.gov/venus/) and [Saturn](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/facts/) created just such an [iconic facial expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley). Specifically, a crescent Moon appeared to make a [happy face on the night sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171112.html) when paired with seemingly nearby planets. Pictured is the scene as it appeared over [Zacatecas](https://youtu.be/GvCIXH1AKoE), [MÃ©xico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico), with distinctive [Bufa Hill](https://youtu.be/0zHHG4RpfYM?t=56) in the foreground. On the far right and farthest in the distance is the [planet Saturn](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200419.html). Significantly closer and visible to Saturn's upper left is [Venus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210317.html), the brightest planet on the sky. Just above the central horizon is [Earth's Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190717.html) in a [waning crescent](https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/54/phases-of-the-moon/) phase. To create this gigantic icon, the crescent moon phase must be [smiling](https://media.tenor.com/5Wox2TQlBowAAAAM/cat-smiley-cat.gif) in the correct direction.
