Jupiter looks sharp in these two [rooftop telescope images](https://www.glitteringlights.com/). Both were captured on November 17 from Singapore, planet Earth, about two weeks after [Jupiter's 2023 opposition](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231103.html). Climbing high in midnight skies the giant planet was a mere 33.4 light-minutes from Singapore. That's about 4 astronomical units away. Jupiter's planet girdling [dark belts and light zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#Zones,_belts_and_jets) are visible in remarkable detail, along with the giant world's [whitish oval](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211229.html) vortices. Its signature [Great Red Spot](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220717.html) is still prominent in the south. Jupiter rotates rapidly on its axis once every 10 hours. So, based on video frames taken only 15 minutes apart, these images form a stereo pair. Look at the center of the pair and cross your eyes until the separate images come together to see the [Solar System's ruling gas giant](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/) in 3D.
