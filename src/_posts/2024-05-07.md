What happens when a black hole devours a star? Many details remain unknown, but observations are providing new clues. In 2014, a [powerful explosion](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa6003) was recorded by the ground-based robotic telescopes of the [All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/index.shtml) (Project ASAS-SN), with followed-up observations by instruments including [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s Earth-orbiting [Swift satellite](https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Computer modeling of these emissions fit a star being [ripped apart](https://thedoorguardian.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DOG-14.jpg) by a distant [supermassive black hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130312.html). The results of such a collision are portrayed in the [featured artistic illustration](https://news.mit.edu/2017/black-hole-choking-stardust-0315). The [black hole](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/black-holes/) itself is a depicted as a tiny black dot in the center. As matter falls toward [the hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220501.html), it collides with other matter and [heats up](http://stronggravity.eu/public-outreach-tmp/accretion-disks/). Surrounding the black hole is an [accretion disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050312.html) of hot matter that used to be the star, with a [jet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131120.html) emanating from the [black hole's spin axis](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011029.html).
