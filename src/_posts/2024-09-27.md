[The twenty galaxies](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...671A.141M/abstract) arrayed in these panels are part of an ambitious astronomical survey of tidal stellar streams. Each panel presents a composite view; a deep, inverted image taken from publicly [available imaging surveys](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157..168D/abstract) of a field that surrounds a [nearby](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240703.html) massive galaxy image. The inverted images reveal faint cosmic structures, star streams hundreds of thousands of light-years across, that result from the gravitational disruption and [eventual merger of satellite galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191116.html) in the [local universe](https://www.astro.wisc.edu/research/research-areas/extragalactic-astronomy-and-cosmology/local-universe/). Such surveys of mergers and gravitational tidal interactions between massive galaxies and their dwarf satellites are [crucial guides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03585) for current models of galaxy formation and cosmology. Of course, the detection of stellar streams in the neighboring Andromeda Galaxy and [our own Milky Way](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130815.html) also offers spectacular evidence for ongoing satellite galaxy disruption within our more [local galaxy group](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/local_group_info.html).
