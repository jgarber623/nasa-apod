[Epsilon Tauri](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/ain.html) lies 146 light-years away. A K-type [red giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant) star, epsilon Tau is cooler than the Sun, but with about 13 times the solar radius it has nearly 100 times the solar luminosity. A member of the [Hyades](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121224.html) open star cluster the giant star is known by the [proper name Ain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proper_names_of_stars), and along with brighter giant star Aldebaran, forms the eyes of Taurus the Bull. Surrounded by dusty, dark clouds in Taurus, epsilon Tau is also known to have a planet. Discovered by [radial velocity](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/ways-to-find-a-planet/#/1) measurements in 2006, [Epsilon Tauri b](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/7044/epsilon-tauri-b/) is a gas giant planet larger than Jupiter with an orbital period of 1.6 years. And though the exoplanet can't be seen directly, on a dark night its parent star epsilon Tauri is easily visible to the unaided eye.
