What do the Earth and Moon look like from beyond the Moon? Although [frequently](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171204.html) [photographed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011015.html) [together](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100901.html), the familiar duo was captured with this unusual perspective in late 2022 by the robotic [Orion spacecraft](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/orion-spacecraft/) of [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s [Artemis I](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-i/) mission as it looped around Earth's most massive satellite and [looked back](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231130.html) toward its home world. Since our [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) is about four times the diameter of the [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/), the satellite’s [seemingly large size](https://www.rover.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pug-tilt.jpg) was caused by the capsule [being closer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_perspective) to the smaller body. [Artemis II](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/), the next launch in NASA’s Artemis series, is currently scheduled to take people around the Moon in 2025, while [Artemis III](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-iii/) is planned to return humans to [lunar surface](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031109.html) in late 2026. Last week, [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/)'s robotic [SLIM](https://global.jaxa.jp/countdown/slim_special_site.html) [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Lander_for_Investigating_Moon), launched from [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan), [landed on the Moon](https://global.jaxa.jp/press/2024/01/20240120-1_e.html) and released two hopping rovers.
