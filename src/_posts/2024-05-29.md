What happens if you ascend this [stairway](https://youtu.be/xbhCPt6PZIU) to the Milky Way? Before answering that, let's understand the beautiful sky you will see. Most eye-catching is the grand arch of the [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/), the [band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110710.html) that is the central disk of our galaxy which is [straight](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230702.html) but distorted by the wide-angle nature of [this composite image](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6hAjiSLuxd/). Many stars well in front of the Milk Way will be visible, with the bright white star just below the [stellar arch](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221023.html) being [Altair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair), and the bright blue star above it being [Vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega). The [air glows](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220313.html) green on the left, just above the yellow cloud deck. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6hAjiSLuxd/) was taken last month on [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal)'s [Madeira Island](https://youtu.be/Y29s7aPfKeY?t=7) in the North [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean). Oh, and what happens after you reach the top of these stairs and [admire](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040808.html) the amazing sky is, quite probably, that you then [descend down the stairs](https://youtu.be/fDKDC_IUnOA?t=20) on the other side.
