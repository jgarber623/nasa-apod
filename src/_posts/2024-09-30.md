The new comet has passed its closest to the Sun and is now moving closer to the Earth. [C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshanâ€“ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_\(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS\)) is currently moving out from inside the orbit of [Venus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210317.html) and on track to [pass](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200504.html) its nearest to the [Earth](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/) in about two weeks. Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, [pronounced "Choo-cheen-shahn At-less,"](https://www.instagram.com/babaktafreshi/p/DAOfV4tPaCe/), is near naked-eye visibility and easily picked up by long-exposure cameras. The comet can also now be found by observers in Earth's northern hemisphere as well as the south. The featured image was captured just a few days ago above [Zacatecas](https://youtu.be/JiIIAFeW56E), [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico). Because clouds were obscuring much of the pre-dawn sky, the astrophotographer released a [drone](https://www.ctia.org/news/up-up-and-away-how-do-drones-work) to take pictures from higher up, several of which were later merged to enhance the comet's visibility. Although the future brightness of comets is [hard to predict](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/small-gray-cat-lies-on-600nw-2165991979.jpg), there is increasing hope that [Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS](https://theskylive.com/c2023a3-info) will further brighten as it enters the early evening sky.
