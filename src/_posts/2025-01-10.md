[An unassuming region](https://www.astrobin.com/dfzy51/) in the constellation Taurus holds these dark and dusty nebulae. Scattered through the scene, stars in multiple star systems are forming within their natal [Taurus molecular cloud](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...675A.206S/abstract) complex some 450 light-years away. Millions of years [young](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1976ApJS...30..307R/abstract) and still going through stellar adolescence, [the stars are](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/T/T+Tauri+Stars) variable in brightness and in the [late phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1675) of their gravitational collapse. Known as [T-Tauri](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220210.html) class stars they tend to be faint and take on a yellowish hue in the image. One of the brightest T-Tauri stars in Taurus, V773 (aka HD283447) is near the center of the telescopic frame that spans over 1 degree. Toward the top is the dense, [dark marking](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090425.html) on the sky cataloged as Barnard 209.
