The top image was taken in 2020 and shows Saturn's rings very clearly, whereas the bottom image was taken in 2025 and the rings are only visible as a dark line across the planet. The six images show the progression year by year. Please see the explanation for more detailed information.",

Where are Saturn's ears? [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) is credited, in 1610, as the first person to see [Saturn's rings](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/saturns-rings-2/). Testing out [Lipperhey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Lipperhey)'s recently [co-invented telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_telescope), Galileo did not know what they were and so called them "[ears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#History)". The mystery deepened in 1612, when Saturn's ears [mysteriously disappeared](https://www.petsonme.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Why-Do-Dogs-tilt-their-head-scaled.jpeg). Today we know exactly what happened: from the perspective of the [Earth](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/), Saturn's rings had become [too thin](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100215.html) to see. The same drama [plays out](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150621.html) every 15 years because Saturn, like Earth, undergoes [tilt-driven seasons](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/en/). This means that as Saturn goes around the Sun, its [equator](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/equator_.png) and [rings](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180424.html) can tilt noticeably toward the Sun and inner [Solar System](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/#/home), making them easily visible, but from other orbital locations will appear almost not at all. The [featured picture](https://telescopius.com/pictures/view/224831/planet/by-natan_fontes) from [Brasilia](https://youtu.be/m8fZeZTN0TE), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil) shows a modern version of this sequence: the top ring-dominated image was taken in 2020, while the bottom ring-obscure image taken earlier in 2025.
