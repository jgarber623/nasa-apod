About 12 seconds into this video, something unusual happens. The Earth begins to rise. Never seen by humans before, the [rise of the Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150906.html) over the limb of the Moon occurred about 55.5 years ago and surprised and amazed the crew of [Apollo 8](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/apollo-8/). The [crew](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/apollo-8-astronaut-bill-anders-captures-earthrise/) immediately [scrambled](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-story-behind-apollo-8s-famous-earthrise-photo/) to take still images of the [stunning vista](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/earthrise-3/) caused by [Apollo 8](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/moon-apollo-8-insider-stories/)'s orbit around the Moon. The [featured video](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4593) is a modern reconstruction of the event as it would have looked were it recorded with a modern movie camera. The colorful orb of [our Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/) stood out as a familiar [icon rising](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4129) above a distant and [unfamiliar moonscape](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031109.html), the whole scene the conceptual reverse of a [more familiar moonrise](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170616.html) as seen from Earth. To many, the scene also spoke about the unity of humanity: that big [blue marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble) -- that's us -- we all live there. The [two-minute video](https://youtu.be/1R5QqhPq1Ik) is not time-lapse -- this is the real speed of the Earth rising through the windows of [Apollo 8](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/science/earthrise-moon-apollo-nasa.html). Seven months and three missions later, [Apollo 11](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo11.html) astronauts would not only circle Earth's moon, but [land on it](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap981004.html).
