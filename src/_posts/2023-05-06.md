[Transformed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220422.html) into the petals of a flower, 16 exposures show the passage of day into night in this [creative timelapse skyscape](https://www.dariogiannobile.com/p605599922/h6a198f02#h6a198f02). Start at the top and move counterclockwise to follow consecutive moments as the twilight sky turns an ever darker blue and night blossoms. Each exposure was recorded on the [evening of April 22](https://www.dariogiannobile.com/night_sky_galleries/nightscape/h6fec4a2d#h6fec4a2d), calculated to maintain a consistent balance of light and color. Close to the western horizon on that date, a crescent Moon and Venus are the two brightest [celestial beacons](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/). Petal to petal the pair spiral closer to the flower's center. In silhouette around the center of the twilight flower are Sicily's megalithic rocks of [Argimusco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argimusco).
