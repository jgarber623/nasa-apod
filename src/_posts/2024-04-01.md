What's happening to the big black hole in the center of our galaxy? It is sucking in matter from a swirling disk -- a disk that is [magnetized](https://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Imagnet.html), it has now been confirmed. Specifically, the [black hole's accretion disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140323.html) has recently been seen to emit [polarized light](https://youtu.be/E9qpbt0v5Hw), radiation frequently associated with a [magnetized source](https://youtu.be/60qnTvDbOZ0). [Pictured here](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/blog/astronomers-unveil-strong-magnetic-fields-spiraling-edge-milky-way%E2%80%99s-central-black-hole) is a close-up of Sgr A\*, our [Galaxy's central black hole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220513.html), taken by [radio telescopes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201009.html) [around the world](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/array) participating in the [Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/organization). Superposed are illustrative curved lines indicating [polarized light](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/light/Lesson-1/Polarization) likely emitted from swirling magnetized gas that will soon fall into the 4+ million mass [central black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*). The central part of this image is likely dark because little light-emitting gas is visible between us and the [dark event](https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html) [horizon](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993AmJPh..61..619N/abstract) of the black hole. [Continued EHT monitoring](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/science) of this and M87's central black hole may [yield new clues](https://i.imgflip.com/6wndv2.png) about the gravity of black holes and how infalling matter creates [disks](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200825.html) and [jets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230919.html).
