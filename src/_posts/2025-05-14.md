[This pretty nebula](https://www.instagram.com/p/DE-YG3CouEd/) lies some 1,500 light-years away, its shape and color in this telescopic view reminiscent of a [robin's egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_egg_blue#/media/File:American_Robin_Eggs_in_Nest.jpg). The cosmic cloud spans about 3 [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/)s, nestled securely within the boundaries of the southern constellation of the Furnace ([Fornax](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/fornax.html)). Recognized as a [planetary nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula), egg-shaped [NGC 1360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1360) doesn't represent a beginning, [though](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1h4ato/thinking_cat_is_thinking/#lightbox). Instead, it corresponds to a brief and final phase in the evolution of an [aging star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution#Mature_stars). [In fact](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10891), visible at the center of the nebula, the central star of NGC 1360 is known to be a [binary star system](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970219.html) likely consisting of two evolved [white dwarf stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000910.html), less massive but much hotter than [the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221106.html). Their intense and otherwise invisible [ultraviolet radiation](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/) has stripped away [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron)s from the atoms in their mutually surrounding gaseous shroud. The [blue-green hue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_egg_blue) inside of NGC 1360 seen here is the strong emission produced as electrons recombine with [doubly ionized oxygen atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulium).
