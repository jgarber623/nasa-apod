She knew everything but the question. She was well aware that there would be a complete [annular eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2023/where-when/) of the [Sun](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/menu/sun/) visible from their driving destination: [Lake Abert](https://youtu.be/4gBGuH60JGI) in [Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon). She knew that the next [ring-of-fire eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231001.html) would occur in the [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) only in [16 more years](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2039-june-21), making this a rare photographic opportunity. She was comfortable with the plan: that she and her boyfriend would appear in front of the eclipse [in silhouette](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220107.html), sometimes alone, and sometimes together. She knew that the [annular phase](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230924.html) of this eclipse would last only a few minutes and she helped in the many [hours of planning](https://doggymomblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/map-reading-dog.jpg). She could see their friend who set up the [camera](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/learn/project/how-to-make-a-pinhole-camera/) about 400 meters away at the bottom of a ridge. What she didn't know was the question she would be asked. But she did know the answer: "yes".
