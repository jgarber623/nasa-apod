[On flight day 13](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2022/11/28/artemis-i-flight-day-13-orion-goes-the-max-distance/) (November 28, 2022) of the Artemis I mission, the Orion spacecraft reached its maximum distance from its home world. Over 430,000 kilometers from Earth in a distant retrograde orbit, Orion surpassed the record for most distant spacecraft designed to carry humans. That record was previously set in 1970 during the [Apollo 13 mission to the Moon.](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200303.html) Both Earth and Moon are in the [same field of view](https://images.nasa.gov/details-art001m1013321641_1) in this video frame from Orion on Artemis I mission flight day 13. The planet and its large natural satellite even appear about the same apparent size from the uncrewed [spacecraft's perspective](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/view-the-best-images-from-nasas-artemis-i-mission/).
