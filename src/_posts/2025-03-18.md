There is no sea on Earth large enough to contain the Shark nebula. This [predator](https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/endoceansharks/) apparition poses us no danger as it is composed only of interstellar gas and [dust](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html). Dark dust like that [featured here](https://www.astrobin.com/6ekkcw/) is somewhat like cigarette smoke and [created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust#Dust_grain_formation) in the cool atmospheres of giant [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/). After expelling gas and [gravitationally recondensing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbdwTwB8jtc), massive stars may [carve intricate structures](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221020.html) into their birth cloud using their high energy light and fast [stellar wind](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000318.html)s as sculpting tools. The heat they generate evaporates the murky [molecular cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html) as well as causing ambient hydrogen gas to disperse and glow red. During disintegration, we [humans](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190818.html) can enjoy [imagining](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120124.html) these [great clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141008.html) as [common icons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia), like we do for [water clouds](https://cloudappreciationsociety.org/) on Earth. Including [smaller dust nebulae](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1509/shark_toet_1000_anno.jpg) such as Van den Bergh 149 & 150, the [Shark nebula](https://www.galactic-hunter.com/post/the-shark-nebula), sometimes cataloged as LDN 1235, spans about 15 light years and lies about 650 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) away toward the constellation of the King of Aethiopia ([Cepheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus_\(constellation\))).
