Squids on Earth aren't this big. This mysterious squid-like cosmic cloud spans nearly three [full moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html)s on planet Earth's sky. [Discovered in 2011 by](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012RMxAA..48..223A/abstract) French astro-imager [Nicolas Outters](http://outters.fr/wp/?page_id=50), the Squid Nebula's [bipolar shape](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230416.html) is distinguished [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7g5JleMv90/) by the telltale blue [emission from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulium) doubly ionized [oxygen](https://youtu.be/uPK_rSf1WUc) atoms. Though apparently [surrounded by](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230817.html) the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been [difficult to determine](https://www.shutterstock.com/shutterstock/videos/1048890202/thumb/1.jpg). Still, one [investigation](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...570A.105C/abstract) suggests Ou4 really does lie [within Sh2-129](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210723.html) some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a [triple system](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/orbits.html) of hot, massive stars, cataloged as [HR8119](https://in-the-sky.org/data/object.php?id=TYC3965-880-1#google_vignette), seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 [light-year](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/)s across.
