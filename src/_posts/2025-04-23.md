This surprising sky has almost everything. First, slanting down from the upper left and far in the distance is the [central band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220313.html) of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/). More modestly, slanting down from the upper right and high in [Earth's atmosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-atmosphere/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/) is a [bright meteor](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110123.html). The dim band of light across the central diagonal is [zodiacal light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiacal_light): sunlight reflected from [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust) in the inner [Solar System](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/). The green glow on the far right is [aurora](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240612.html) high in [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-earths-atmosphere/). The bright zigzagging bright line near the bottom is just a light that was held by the scene-planning [astrophotographer](https://www.astronomy.com/observing/capturing-the-cosmos-how-to-be-an-astrophotographer/). This "[almost everything](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201021.html)" sky was captured over rocks on [Castle Hill](https://youtu.be/6NM2c15BHBM), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) late last month. The featured [finished frame](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHse6P6uKZj/) is a combination of 10 exposures all taken with the same camera and from the same location. But what about the astrophotographer himself? He's pictured too -- can you [find him](https://www.mediastorehouse.co.uk/p/617/tabby-kitten-looking-pot-plant-9446207.jpg)?
