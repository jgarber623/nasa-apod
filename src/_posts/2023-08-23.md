It came from [outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Came_from_Outer_Space). It -- in this case a [sand-sized bit](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011117.html) of a [comet nucleus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200315.html) -- was likely ejected many years ago from Sun-orbiting [Comet Swift-Tuttle](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/109p-swift-tuttle/in-depth/), but then continued to orbit the Sun alone. When the Earth crossed through this orbit, the piece of comet debris impacted the [atmosphere of our fair planet](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/en/) and was seen as a meteor. This [meteor deteriorated](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230724.html), causing gases to be emitted that glowed in colors emitted by its component elements. The featured image was taken last week from [Castilla La Mancha](https://youtu.be/MeEYLreMbpw), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain), during the peak night of the [Perseids meteor shower](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230809.html). The picturesque meteor streak happened to appear in the [only](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1240888678/photo/the-surprised-cat-the-amazement-of-the-cat-open-your-mouth-in-surprise-an-extreme-degree-of.webp?b=1&s=170667a&w=0&k=20&c=DREvaissymPAAG3WlYALFfuNTm8WrmPhcjLdejOsaQs=) one of 50 frames that also included the [Andromeda galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191014.html). Stars dot the frame, each much further away than the meteor. Compared to the stars, the [Andromeda galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230322.html) (M31) is, again, much further away.
