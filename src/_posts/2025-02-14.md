The Rosette Nebula, NGC 2237, is not the only cosmic cloud of gas and dust to [evoke](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150217.html) the [imagery](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070524.html) of [flowers](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap051229.html), but it is probably the most famous. At the edge of a large [molecular cloud](http://www.gb.nrao.edu/~rmaddale/Education/OrionTourCenter/monr2.html) in Monoceros some 5,000 light years away, the petals of this cosmic rose are actually a stellar nursery. The lovely, symmetric shape is [sculpted by the winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind) and [radiation](https://srag.jsc.nasa.gov/spaceradiation/what/what.cfm) from its central cluster of [hot young, O-type stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070726.html). Stars in the [energetic cluster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ4n2HjppWo), cataloged [as NGC 2244](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_2244), are only a few million years young, while the central cavity in the Rosette Nebula, is about 50 [light-years](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/how_long_is_a_light_year.htm) in diameter. The nebula can be seen with a small telescope toward the constellation of [Monoceros](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/monoceros.html), the Unicorn. This natural appearing [telescopic portrait](https://www.astrobin.com/sa1a9d/) of the Rosette Nebula was made using broadband color filters, but sometimes [roses aren't red](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180222.html).
