There's a new space telescope in the sky: [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid). Equipped with two large panoramic cameras, [Euclid captures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid_(spacecraft)) light from the [visible](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) to the near-[infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/). It took five hours of observing for [Euclid's 1.2-meter diameter primary mirror](https://sci.esa.int/web/euclid/-/57042-euclid-primary-mirror) to capture, through its [sharp optics](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/cat-looking-surprised-peering-over-the-edge-of-the-picture-john-daniels.jpg), the 1000+ galaxies in the [Perseus cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110712.html), which lies 250 million [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) away. More than 100,000 galaxies are visible in the background, some as [far away](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220316.html) as 10 billion light years. The revolutionary nature of [Euclid](https://www.euclid-ec.org/public/science/) lies in the combination of its wide field of view (twice the area of the full moon), its high angular resolution (thanks to its [620 Megapixel camera](https://irfu.cea.fr/dap/en/Phocea/Vie_des_labos/Ast/ast.php?t=fait_marquant&id_ast=4736)), and its infrared vision, which captures both images and [spectra](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/s/Spectroscopy). [Euclid's initial surveys](https://www.euclid-ec.org/public/data/surveys/), covering a third of the sky and recording over 2 billion galaxies, will enable a [study](https://youtu.be/-rHGTVJfcWI) of how [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) and [dark energy](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy/) have shaped [our universe](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AmJPh..76..265N/abstract).
