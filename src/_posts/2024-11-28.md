The large stellar association cataloged as [NGC 206](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990402.html) is nestled within the dusty arms of the neighboring [Andromeda galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220119.html) along with the galaxy's pinkish star-forming regions. Also known as M31, [the spiral galaxy is a mere](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/milky-way-collide.html) 2.5 million light-years away. NGC 206 is found at the center of [this sharp and detailed close-up](https://www.astrobin.com/s57ghl/) of the southwestern [extent](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200925.html) of Andromeda's disk. The bright, blue [stars of NGC 206](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.405.1531E/abstract) indicate its youth. In fact, its youngest massive stars are less than 10 million years old. Much larger than the open or galactic clusters of young stars [in the disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120912.html) [of our Milky Way galaxy,](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/undefined) [NGC 206](http://messier.seds.org/more/m031_n206.html) spans about 4,000 light-years. That's comparable in size to the giant stellar nurseries [NGC 604](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240425.html) in nearby spiral M33 and the [Tarantula Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240308.html) in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
