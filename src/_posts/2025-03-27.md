One of the brightest galaxies in planet Earth's sky is similar in size to our Milky Way Galaxy: big, [beautiful Messier 81](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-81/). Also known as NGC 3031 or Bode's galaxy for its 18th century discoverer, this grand spiral can be found toward the northern constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear. [The sharp, detailed telescopic](https://fenyeslorand.hu/m81/) view reveals M81's bright yellow nucleus, blue spiral arms, pinkish starforming regions, and sweeping [cosmic dust lanes](http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/1070-ssc2003-06c-Spiral-Galaxy-Messier-81). But some dust lanes actually run through the galactic disk (left of center), contrary to other prominent [spiral](http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr222/Galaxies/Spiral/spiral.html) features. The [errant dust lanes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010112.html) may be the lingering result of a [close encounter between](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200515.html) M81 and the nearby galaxy M82 lurking outside of this frame. Scrutiny of variable stars in M81 has yielded a [well-determined distance](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ApJ...427..628F) for an external galaxy -- 11.8 million light-years.
