Get out your [red/blue glasses](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/Help/VendorList.html#Glasses) and check out this stereo view of another world. The [scene was recorded](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a17/a17.html) by Apollo 17 mission commander Eugene Cernan on December 11, 1972, one orbit before descending to land on the Moon. The stereo anaglyph was assembled from two photographs ([AS17-147-22465, AS17-147-22466](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/images17.html)) captured from his vantage point on board the [Lunar Module](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191219.html) Challenger as he and Dr. Harrison Schmitt flew over Apollo 17's [landing site](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110908.html) in the [Taurus-Littrow Valley](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17OTM.html). The broad, sunlit face of the mountain dubbed South Massif rises near the center [of the frame](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.22465lbl.jpg), above the dark floor of Taurus-Littrow to its left. Piloted by Ron Evans, the Command Module America is visible in orbit in the foreground against the [South Massif's peak](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap071214.html). Beyond the mountains, toward the lunar limb, lies the Moon's [Mare Serenitatis](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090206.html). Four astronauts will venture around the Moon and back again on the [Artemis II mission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/), scheduled for launch no earlier than September 2025.
