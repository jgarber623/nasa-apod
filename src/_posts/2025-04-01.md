Can the Sun appear to rise twice at the same time? This was just the case a few days ago from [Les Escoumins](https://youtu.be/qyYLKDzV5lc), [Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) as our [Solar System's bright central orb](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) rose just as it was being [partially eclipsed](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2025-march-29) by the Moon. The [featured video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHzM20ySGvE/) shows this unusual double-sunrise in real time and being reflected by the [St. Lawrence River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lawrence_River). Soon after the initial two spots of light appear over distant clouds, what appears to be [bright horns](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231009.html) become visible -- which are really just parts of the Sun not being eclipsed. Soon, the [entire eclipsed Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250330.html) is visible above the horizon. In all, this broken [sunrise](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241003.html) took less than two minutes during a [partial eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/types/) that lasted many times longer. Although the Moon [circles](https://i.imgur.com/v1fUvO4.jpeg) the Earth once a month (moon-th), it does not always eclipse [the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231119.html) because its [tilted orbit](https://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/why-dont-we-have-an-eclipse-every-month) usually takes it above or below.
