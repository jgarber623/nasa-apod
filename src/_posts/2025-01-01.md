The closest star system to the Sun is the [Alpha Centauri system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_centauri). Of the three stars in the system, the dimmest -- called [Proxima Centauri](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160118.html) -- is actually the [nearest star](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/nearstar.html). The bright stars [Alpha Centauri](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/rigil-kent.html) A and B form a close [binary](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970219.html) as they are separated by only 23 times the [Earth- Sun distance](https://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/301-What-is-an-Astronomical-Unit-) - slightly greater than the distance between [Uranus](https://science.nasa.gov/uranus/) and the [Sun](http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=18012). The [Alphasystem](https://youtu.be/4uBG_Xowyp4) is not visible in much of the northern hemisphere. Alpha Centauri A, also known as [Rigil Kentaurus](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/rigil-kent.html), is the brightest star in the constellation of [Centaurus](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/centaurus.html) and is the fourth brightest star in the night sky. [Sirius](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000611.html) is the brightest even though it is more than twice as far away. By an [exciting](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/29l2wk/a_very_happy_cat/#lightbox) coincidence, [Alpha Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri) A is the same type of star as our [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/), and Proxima Centauri is now known to have a [potentially habitable exoplanet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160825.html).
