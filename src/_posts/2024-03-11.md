Unusually, the setting moon images line up almost vertically. In the foreground is a beach with waves illuminated by blue-glowing plankton. Please see the explanation for more detailed information.",

What glows in the night? This night [featured](https://www.petrhoralek.com/?p=23460) a combination of usual and unusual glows. Perhaps the most usual glow was from [the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html), a potentially familiar object. The full Moon's nearly [vertical descent](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/upside-down.html) results from the observer being near [Earth's equator](https://www.timeanddate.com/geography/equator.html). As the Moon sets, [air](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/) and [aerosol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol)s in [Earth's atmosphere](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2919/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/) preferentially scatter out blue light, making the [Sun-reflecting satellite](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220515.html) appear reddish when near the horizon. Perhaps the most [unusual glow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170418.html) was from the bioluminescent [plankton](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230529.html), likely less familiar objects. These [microscopic creatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton#/media/File:Marine_microplankton.jpg) glow blue, it is thought, primarily to [surprise](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6323a9e201619b7ff6df9568/635aeda78b9def627cb87ff2_How%20to%20Handle%20a%20Frightened%20Dog.jpg) and [deter predators](https://www.earth.com/news/marine-plankton-glow-predators/). In this case, the glow was caused primarily by plankton-containing waves crashing onto the beach. The image was taken on [Soneva Fushi Island](https://youtu.be/xtK4gKNJXpA?t=18), [Maldives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives) just over one year ago.
