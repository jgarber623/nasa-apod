How big is our universe? This question, [among others](http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1995PASP%2E%2E107%2E1133T), was debated by two leading astronomers in 1920 in what has since become known as [astronomy's Great Debate](https://apod.nasa.gov/debate/debate100th.html). Many astronomers then believed that our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/) was the entire universe. Many others, though, believed that our galaxy was just [one of many](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap020901.html). In the [Great Debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy)), each argument was detailed, but no consensus was reached. The answer came over three years later with the detected variation of single spot in the [Andromeda Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170303.html), as shown on the [original glass discovery plate digitally reproduced here](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/PAST/m31var). When [Edwin Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble) compared images, he noticed that this [spot varied](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960406.html), and on October 6, 1923 wrote "VAR!" on the plate. The best explanation, Hubble knew, was that this spot was the [image of a variable star](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2011/15/2851-Image.html) that was very far away. So M31 was really the [Andromeda _Galaxy_](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190909.html) \-- a galaxy possibly similar to our own. Annotated 100 years ago, the [featured image](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/PAST/m31var) may not be pretty, but the variable spot on it opened a window through which humanity gazed knowingly, for the first time, into a [surprisingly vast cosmos](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200405.html).
