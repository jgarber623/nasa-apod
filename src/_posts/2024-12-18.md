What kind of strange galaxy is this? This rare structure is known as a [polar ring galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar-ring_galaxy), and it seems to have two different rings of stars. In this galaxy, [NGC 660](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141108.html), one ring of bright stars, gas, and dark dust appears nearly vertical, while another similar but shorter ring runs diagonally from the upper left. How polar ring galaxies [obtain](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231024.html) their striking appearance remains a [topic of research](https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/68/54/15/685415485a101db87fa6023548eec83f.jpg), but a leading theory holds that it is usually the result of two galaxies with different central ring planes [colliding](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130514.html). NGC 660 spans about 50,000 light years and is located about 40 million [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) away toward the constellation of the Fish ([Pisces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisces_\(constellation\))). The [featured image](https://throughlightandtime.com/ngc-660-lrgb-rev-1-crop-cdk-1000-22-nov-2024-2/) was captured recently from [Observatorio El Sauce](https://youtu.be/S4rFdr2Qmjk) in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile).
