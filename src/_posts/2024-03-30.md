Discovered by accident, this manuscript page provides graphical insight to astronomy in medieval times, before the [Renaissance](http://www.spacetoday.org/History/MillenniumTimeline/16thCentury.html) and the influence of [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus), [Tycho de Brahe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010107.html), [Johannes Kepler](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180515.html), and [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei). The intriguing page is from lecture notes on astronomy compiled by the monk Magister Wolfgang de Styria before the year 1490. The top panels clearly illustrate the necessary geometry for a lunar (left) and solar eclipse in the Earth-centered [Ptolemaic system](http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/theories/ptolemaic_system.html). At lower left is a diagram of the Ptolemaic view of the [Solar System](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/#/home) with text at the upper right to explain the movement of the planets according to [Ptolemy's geocentric](https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/58/1/1.42/2938122) model. At the lower right is a chart to calculate the [date](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090416.html) of Easter Sunday in the [Julian](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240229.html) calendar. The illustrated manuscript page was found at historic [Melk Abbey](https://www.stiftmelk.at/) in Austria.
