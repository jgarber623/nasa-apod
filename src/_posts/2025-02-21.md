The largest photomosaic ever assembled from Hubble Space Telescope image data is a panoramic view of our neighboring spiral Andromeda Galaxy. With 600 overlapping frames assembled from observations made from July 2010 to December 2022, the full [Hubble Andromeda Galaxy mosaic](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2025/005/01JGY8JKWBHBWJ71V3QQTKM382) spans almost six full moons across [planet Earth's sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200925.html). A cropped version shown above is nearly two full moons across and partially covers Andromeda's core and inner spiral arms. Also known as M31, the [Andromeda Galaxy is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) 2.5 million light-years away. That makes it the closest large spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way. Our perspective on the spiral Milky Way is [anchored to the view](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110520.html) from the [location of the Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/), a star found within the Milky Way's galactic disk. But Hubble's magnificent Andromeda mosaic offers an expansive view of a large spiral galaxy from the outside looking in. Hubble's comprehensive, [detailed](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...755..131R/abstract) [data set](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...979...35C/abstract) extending [across the Andromeda Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/nasas-hubble-traces-hidden-history-of-andromeda-galaxy/) will allow astronomers to make an unprecedented holistic exploration of the mysteries of spiral galaxy structure and evolution.
