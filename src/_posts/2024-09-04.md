Can you see the bat? It haunts [this cosmic close-up](https://www.astrobin.com/8goim6/) of the eastern [Veil Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_Nebula). The [Veil Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191031.html) itself is a large supernova remnant, the expanding debris cloud from the [death explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyntBsxoEkA) of a massive [star](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/universe_level1/stars.html). While the Veil is roughly [circular](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-interactive-unit-circle.html) in shape and covers nearly 3 degrees on the sky toward the constellation of the Swan ([Cygnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_\(constellation\))), NGC 6995, known informally as the Bat Nebula, spans only 1/2 degree, about the apparent size [of the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130801.html). That [translates](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/scale_distance.html) to 12 light-years at the Veil's estimated distance, a reassuring 1,400 light-years from [planet Earth](https://www.globe.gov/en). In the composite of image data recorded through [narrow band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap071102.html) filters, emission from [hydrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml) atoms in the remnant is shown in red with strong emission from [oxygen](https://youtu.be/5Q3ft8OsFaM) atoms shown in hues of blue. Of course, in the western part of the Veil lies [another](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1Kl4rNUTWCA/hqdefault.jpg) seasonal apparition: [the Witch's Broom](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180408.html) Nebula.
