[If the Sun is up](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto/albums/72177720315879304/) but the sky is dark and the horizon is bright all around, you might be standing in the Moon's shadow during a total eclipse of the Sun. In fact, the all-sky Moon shadow shown in this composited panoramic view was captured from a farm near Shirley, Arkansas, planet Earth. The exposures were made under clear skies during the [April 8 total solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/april-8-total-solar-eclipse-through-the-eyes-of-nasa/). For that location near the center line of the Moon's shadow track, totality lasted over 4 minutes. Along with the solar corona surrounding the [silhouette of the Moon](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.410844681644115&type=3) planets and stars were visible during the total eclipse phase. [Easiest to see here](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2404/20240408h14La.jpg) are bright planets Venus and Jupiter, to the lower right and upper left of the eclipsed Sun.
