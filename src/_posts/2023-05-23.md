Big storms are different on Jupiter. On Earth, huge [hurricanes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171127.html) and colossal [cyclones](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210915.html) are centered on regions of low pressure, but on Jupiter, it is the high-pressure, anti-cyclone storms that are the largest. On [Earth](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/in-depth/), large storms can last weeks, but on [Jupiter](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/in-depth/) they can last years. On Earth, large storms can be as large as a country, but on Jupiter, large storms can be as large as planet Earth. Both types of storms are known to exhibit [light](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970512.html)[ning](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040818.html). The [featured image](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing?id=9123) of Jupiter's clouds was composed from images and data captured by the robotic [Juno spacecraft](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/spacecraft/index.html) as it [swooped close](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220828.html) to the massive planet in August 2020.  A swirling [white oval](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia01477-jupiters-white-ovals) is visible nearby, while numerous smaller [cloud swirls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#Vortices) extend into the distance.  On Jupiter, light-colored [clouds](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/chaotic-clouds-of-jupiter) are usually higher up than dark clouds. Despite their differences, studying storm clouds on distant Jupiter provides [insights](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/858935040/photo/black-cat-working-at-the-computer-as-a-developer-online.jpg?b=1&s=170667a&w=0&k=20&c=Sf6SQDgkc--GGpkDIIgmSHuqRt18x-FncocMhH2tAeE=) into storms and other weather patterns on [familiar Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html).
