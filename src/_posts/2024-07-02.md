The clouds may look like an oyster, and the stars like pearls, but look beyond. Near the outskirts of the [Small Magellanic Cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210105.html), a satellite galaxy some 200 thousand light-years distant, lies this 5 million year [old](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/) star cluster [NGC 602](https://youtu.be/LpQgKX1fGxQ). Surrounded by its birth shell of gas and dust, star cluster [NGC 602](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_602) is featured in this [stunning Hubble image](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2007/news-2007-04.html), augmented in a rollover by images in the [X-ray](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays/) by the [Chandra Observatory](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/chandra-x-ray-observatory/) and in the [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) by [Spitzer Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/spitzer/). [Fantastic](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/9d/a6/41/9da64199c08de5d023a91f52ac404273.jpg) ridges and swept back gas strongly suggest that [energetic radiation](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/) and [shock waves](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240104.html) from [NGC 602](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/videos/2007/04/539-Video.html)'s massive young stars have eroded the [dust](https://youtu.be/jn5M48MVWyg)y material and triggered a progression of [star formation](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve) moving away from the star cluster's center. At the estimated distance of the [Small Magellanic Cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230211.html), the [featured picture](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2007/04/2042-Image.html) spans about 200 light-years, but a [tantalizing](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/videos/2007/04/539-Video.html) assortment of background galaxies are also visible in [this sharp view](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2013/ngc602/). The [background galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210802.html) are hundreds of millions of light-years -- or more -- [beyond NGC 602](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150307.html).
