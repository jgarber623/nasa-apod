What is the most spook-tacular nebula in the galaxy? One contender is LDN 43, which bears an astonishing resemblance to a vast cosmic [bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat) [flying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat#/media/File:Big-eared-townsend-fledermaus.jpg) amongst the stars on a dark [Halloween](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211024.html) night. Located about 1400 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) away in the constellation [Ophiuchus](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/ophiuchus.html), this [molecular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud) cloud is dense enough to [block light](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html) not only from background stars, but from wisps of gas lit up by the nearby [reflection nebula](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/r/Reflection+Nebula) [LBN 7](http://www.jthommes.com/Astro/LBN7_LDN43.htm). Far from being a harbinger of death, this 12-light year-long filament of gas and [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html) is actually a [stellar nursery](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/). Glowing with [eerie](https://i.pinimg.com/550x/81/21/c0/8121c0291fa14d1fe52b9eb007741cac.jpg) light, the bat is lit up from inside by [dense gaseous knots](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080413.html) that have just formed [young stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220512.html).
