Do you see the hourglass shape -- or does it see you? If you can picture it, the rings of [MyCn 18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engraved_Hourglass_Nebula) trace the outline of an hourglass -- although one with an unusual eye in its center. Either way, the sands of time are running out for the central star of this hourglass-shaped [planetary nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula). With its [nuclear fuel](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/game_changing_development/Nuclear_Thermal_Propulsion_Deep_Space_Exploration) exhausted, this brief, spectacular, closing phase of a [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/)\-like [star's life](http://apod.pl/htmltest/gifcity/msblues.html) occurs as its outer layers are ejected - its core becoming a cooling, fading [white dwarf](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000910.html). In 1995, astronomers used the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010806.html) (HST) to make a series of images of [planetary nebulae](https://esahubble.org/wordbank/planetary-nebula/), including the one featured here. Pictured, delicate rings of colorful glowing gas ([nitrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/7.shtml)\-red, [hydrogen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFptgQ8GA_U)\-green, and [oxygen](http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele008.html)\-blue) outline the tenuous walls of the [hourglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hourglass). The unprecedented sharpness of the Hubble images has revealed [surprising details](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASA...35...27M/abstract) of the [nebula ejection process](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200630.html) that are helping to resolve the outstanding mysteries of the [complex shapes and symmetries of planetary nebulas](http://faculty.washington.edu/balick/pPNe/) like MyCn 18.
