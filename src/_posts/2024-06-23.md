The upper part has dark bands which are shadows and behind the shadows the color of Saturn's atmosphere appears blue. Please see the explanation for more detailed information.",

What creates Saturn's colors? The [featured picture](https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/12713966445/in/dateposted/) of Saturn only slightly exaggerates what a [human](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190818.html) would see if hovering close to the giant ringed world. The image was taken in 2005 by the robot [Cassini spacecraft](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cassini-Huygens/Cassini_spacecraft) that orbited [Saturn](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/) from 2004 to 2017. Here [Saturn's majestic rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_rings) appear directly only as a curved line, appearing brown, in part from its [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) glow. The rings best show their complex structure in the [dark shadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSbCqp_a3iE) they create across the upper part of the planet. The northern hemisphere of [Saturn can appear partly blue](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/saturns-blue-cranium/) for the same reason that [Earth's skies can appear blue](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html) -- molecules in the cloudless portions of both planet's atmospheres are better at scattering blue light than red. When looking deep into [Saturn's clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap051010.html), however, the natural gold hue of Saturn's clouds becomes dominant. It is [not known](https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/04/93/02/15/360_F_493021526_XFLrdVJ5P2sF9GDz3Fsqtcbw8EhcXeQs.jpg) why _southern_ Saturn does not show the same blue hue -- one hypothesis holds that clouds are higher there. It is also [not known](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004cosp...35..466W/abstract) why some of Saturn's [clouds are colored](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960803.html) gold.
