The Great Nebula in Orion is a colorful place. Visible to the unaided eye, it appears as a small [fuzzy patch](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030207.html) in the [constellation of Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_\(constellation\)). Long exposure, [multi-wavelength images](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140115.html) like this, however, show the [Orion Nebula](http://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=M42) to be a busy neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and dark [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html). This [digital composite](http://www.astrobin.com/247510/) features not only three colors of [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) but four colors of [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) taken by [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/)'s orbiting [Spitzer Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/spitzer/) as well. The power behind much of the [Orion Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula) (M42) is the [Trapezium](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240105.html) - four of the brightest stars in the nebula. Many of the [filamentary structures](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190102.html) visible are actually [shock wave](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240104.html)s - fronts where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas. The Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is [located](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap020530.html) about 1500 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) away in the same [spiral arm](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) of [our Galaxy](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html) as the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/).
