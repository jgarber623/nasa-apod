Monitoring 68 [pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar)s with very large [radio telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope)s, the [North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves](https://nanograv.org/science/overview) (NANOGrav) has uncovered evidence for the [gravitational wave](https://nanograv.org/science/topics/low-frequency-gravitational-waves) (GW) [background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave_background) by [carefully measuring](https://nanograv.org/news/15yrRelease) slight shifts in the arrival times of pulses. [These shifts](https://www.seti.org/press-release/nanogravs-15-year-journey-reveals-cosmic-hum) are correlated between different [pulsar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220821.html)s in a way that indicates that they are caused by GWs. This [GW background](https://astrobites.org/2018/01/29/hunting-for-gravitational-waves-from-spinning-neutron-stars/) is likely due to hundreds of thousands or even millions of [supermassive black hole binaries](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181203.html). Teams in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia) and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) have also independently reported their results today. Previously, the [LIGO](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201710/virgo.cfm) and [Virgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_interferometer) detectors have detected higher-frequency GWs from the [merging](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210411.html) of individual [pairs of massive orbiting objects](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211207.html), such as stellar-mass [black holes](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/1068/10-questions-you-might-have-about-black-holes/). The featured illustration highlights this [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime)\-shaking result by depicting two orbiting [supermassive black holes](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/s/supermassive+black+hole) and several of the [pulsars](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/everyone/pulsars/index.html) that would [appear](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/3/cat-looking-surprised-peering-over-the-edge-of-the-picture-john-daniels.jpg) to have slight timing shifts. The imprint these [GWs](https://youtu.be/4GbWfNHtHRg) make on spacetime itself is illustrated by a [distorted grid](https://youtu.be/R7V3koyL7Mc).
