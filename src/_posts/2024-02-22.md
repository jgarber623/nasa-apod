Big, bright, beautiful [spiral, Messier 106](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210409.html) dominates this cosmic vista. The nearly two degree wide [telescopic field of view](https://www.astrobin.com/bwc7h6/) looks toward the well-trained constellation Canes Venatici, near the handle of the Big Dipper. Also known as NGC 4258, M106 is about 80,000 light-years across and 23.5 million light-years away, the largest member of the [Canes II](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galgrps/cvnii.html) galaxy group. For a far far away galaxy, the distance to M106 is well-known in part because it can be [directly measured](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6031) by tracking this galaxy's remarkable maser, or microwave laser emission. Very rare but naturally occurring, the [maser emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_maser) is produced by water molecules in molecular clouds orbiting its [active galactic nucleus](https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1302/). Another prominent spiral galaxy on the scene, viewed nearly [edge-on, is NGC 4217](https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1503a/) below and right of M106. The distance to NGC 4217 is much less well-known, estimated to be about 60 million light-years, but the bright [spiky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_spike) stars are in the foreground, well inside our own Milky Way galaxy.
