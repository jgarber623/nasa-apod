Can you find two Earth shadows in today's image? It's a bit tricky. To find the first shadow, observe that the top part of the [atmosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/en/) appears pink and the lower part appears blue. This is because the top half is exposed to [direct sunlight](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220727.html), while the lower part is not. The purple [area](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100404.html) in between is known as the [Belt of Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_of_Venus), even though Venus can only appear on the other side of the sky, near the [Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/). The [blue color](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191011.html) of the lower atmosphere is caused by the Earth blocking sunlight, creating Earth shadow number 1. Now, where is the second Earth shadow? Take a [look at the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html). Do you notice [something unusual](https://www.intermountainpet.com/hubfs/Blog_Images/Dogs-tilting-their-heads.jpg) about the lower left part? That area appears unusually dark because it is in the [shadow of the Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211201.html), creating Earth shadow number 2. To be precise, the [Moon](https://moon.nasa.gov/) was captured during a [lunar eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180802.html). This carefully timed image was taken in [Sampieri](https://youtu.be/yt3cXQbrvi8), [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), in July 2018.
