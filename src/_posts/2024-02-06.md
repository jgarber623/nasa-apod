What's different about this galaxy? Very little, which makes the [Spanish Dancer galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230508.html), [NGC 1566](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1566), one of the most typical and photogenic [spirals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy) on the sky. There is something different about [this galaxy _image_](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/105/01HM9ZFS5KC07R4TQWFQ0W9HMH), though, because it is a diagonal combination of two images: one by the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/) on the upper left, and the other by the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://webb.nasa.gov/content/about/index.html) on the lower right. The [Hubble image](https://stsci-opo.org/STScI-01HM9ZTYDAR87J4S4J89KW1W7R.png) was taken in [ultraviolet light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/) and highlights the locations of [bright blue stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240129.html) and [dark dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_lane) along the galaxy's impressive spiral arms. In contrast, the [Webb image](https://stsci-opo.org/STScI-01HMA037D847D4Y4046CRSZGQF.png) was taken in [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) and highlights where the [same dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220907.html) emits more light than it absorbed. In the rollover image, the other two sides of these images are revealed. Blinking between the two images shows which [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/) are particularly hot because they glow brighter in ultraviolet light, and the difference between [seemingly empty space](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/f0/a9/bd/f0a9bd84d9b1587607e57c09b97a8c49.jpg) and infrared-glowing dust.
