How was the Crescent Nebula created? Looking like an emerging space [cocoon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231224.html), the Crescent Nebula, visible in the center of the [featured image](https://astroaro.fr/en/en_ngc-6888/), was created by the brightest star in its center. A leading progenitor hypothesis has the [Crescent Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230904.html) beginning to form about 250,000 years ago. At that time, the massive central star had evolved to become a [Wolf-Rayet star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200308.html) (WR 136), shedding its outer envelope in a strong [stellar wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind), ejecting the equivalent of our Sun's mass every 10,000 years. This wind impacted surrounding gas left over from a [previous phase](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/redsup.html), compacting it into a series of [complex shells](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240107.html), and [lighting it up](https://delavanlakesvet.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/195/2022/03/smiling-cat-for-web.jpg). The [Crescent Nebula](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000AJ....119.2991M/abstract), also known as NGC 6888, lies about 4,700 [light-year](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/)s away in the [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/en/) of [Cygnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_\(constellation\)). Star [WR](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/w/wolf-rayet+star) 136 will probably undergo a [supernova](https://youtu.be/wymMn-SmALY) explosion sometime in the next million years.
