To some it looks like a cat's eye. To others, perhaps like a giant cosmic [conch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conch) [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conch#/media/File:Melongena_corona_2.jpg). It is actually one of the brightest and most highly detailed [planetary nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula) known, composed of gas expelled in the brief yet glorious phase near the end of life of a Sun-like star. [This nebula](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0VJ1K93PM)'s dying central star may have produced the outer circular [concentric shells](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...417..637C/abstract) by [shrugging](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011003.html) off [outer](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031101.html) [layers](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200607.html) in a series of regular convulsions. The [formation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOA-19n4tiQ) of the beautiful, complex-yet-symmetric [inner structures](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...759L..28P/abstract), however, is [not well understood](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/banner-three-pets-atttentive-thinking-600nw-2136132101.jpg). The [featured image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rudypohl/40388468763/in/dateposted/) is a composite of a digitally sharpened [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.stsci.edu/hst) image with [X-ray](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays) light [captured by](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/openFITS/multiwavelength_data.html) the orbiting [Chandra Observatory](http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/). The exquisite floating space statue spans over half a [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) across. Of course, [gazing into this Cat's Eye](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220710.html), humanity may well be seeing the fate of our sun, destined to enter its own [planetary nebula phase](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/planetary_nebulae.html) of evolution ... in [about 5 billion years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future#/media/File:Red_Giant_Earth_warm.jpg).
