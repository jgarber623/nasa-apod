Look through the cosmic cloud cataloged as NGC 281 and you might miss the stars of open cluster [IC 1590](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997AJ....113.2116G/abstract). Formed [within the nebula](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2007/ngc281/), that cluster's young, massive stars ultimately power the pervasive nebular glow. The eye-catching shapes looming in the featured portrait of NGC 281 are sculpted dusty columns and dense [Bok globules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bok_globule) seen in silhouette, eroded by intense, energetic winds and [radiation](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) from the hot cluster stars. If they survive long enough, the dusty structures could also be sites of future star formation. [Playfully called](http://www.google.com/pacman/) the Pacman Nebula because of its overall shape, NGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation [Cassiopeia](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cas/). This sharp composite image was made through [narrow-band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap071102.html) filters. It combines emission from the nebula's hydrogen and oxygen atoms to [synthesize](https://hubblesite.org/contents/articles/the-meaning-of-light-and-color) red, green, and blue colors. The scene spans well over 80 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) at the estimated distance of [NGC 281](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_281).
