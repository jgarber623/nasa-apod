The stars are not alone. In the disk of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/), about 10 percent of visible matter is in the form of gas called the [interstellar medium](http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html) (ISM). The ISM is [not uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Bubble) and shows [patchiness](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990503.html) even near our [Sun](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/menu/sun/). It can be quite difficult to detect the [local ISM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Interstellar_Cloud) because it is so tenuous and emits so little light. This mostly [hydrogen](http://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml) gas, however, absorbs some very specific colors that can be detected in the light of the [nearest stars](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/20lys.html). A working map of the local [ISM](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap980225.html) within 20 light-years, based on ongoing observations and particle detections from the Earth-orbiting Interstellar Boundary Exporer satellite ([IBEX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBEX)), is [shown here](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/10906/). These observations indicate that our [Sun is moving](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap020217.html) through a [Local Interstellar Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Interstellar_Cloud) as this cloud flows outwards from the [Scorpius-Centaurus Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpius%E2%80%93Centaurus_Association) star forming [region](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB2stJnmubc#t=28). Our Sun may exit the [Local Cloud](http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3798), also called the Local Fluff, during the next 10,000 years. Much remains unknown about the local [ISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium), including details of its distribution, its origin, and how it affects the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) and the [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html). [Unexpectedly](https://i.imgflip.com/eyvnj.jpg), IBEX [spacecraft](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/ibex/) measurements indicate that the [direction](http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2013/09/06/spacecraft-measures-changes-direction-solar-system-s-interstellar-winds) from which neutral [interstellar particles flow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZaGqnGn5x4) through our Solar System [is changing](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1239925).
