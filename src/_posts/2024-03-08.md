[The Tarantula Nebula](http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n2070.html), also known as 30 Doradus, is more than a thousand light-years in diameter, a giant star forming region within nearby satellite galaxy the [Large Magellanic Cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171013.html). About 180 thousand light-years away, it's the largest, most violent star forming region known in the whole Local Group of galaxies. The cosmic arachnid sprawls across [this magnificent view](http://www.robgendlerastropics.com/Tarantula-HST-ESO-Webb.html), an assembly of image data from large space- and ground-based telescopes. [Within the Tarantula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220907.html) (NGC 2070), intense radiation, stellar winds, and supernova shocks from the central young cluster of massive stars cataloged as R136 energize the nebular glow and shape the spidery filaments. [Around the Tarantula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1602/Tarantula-HST-ESO-annotated1800.jpg) are other star forming regions with young star clusters, filaments, and blown-out [bubble-shaped](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080327.html) clouds. In fact, the frame includes the site of the closest supernova in [modern times, SN 1987A](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/webb-finds-evidence-for-neutron-star-at-heart-of-young-supernova-remnant/), at lower right. The rich field of view spans about 2 degrees or 4 full moons in the southern [constellation Dorado](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/dor/). But were the Tarantula Nebula closer, say 1,500 light-years distant like the Milky Way's own star forming [Orion Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151104.html), it would take up half the sky.
