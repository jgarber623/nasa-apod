Is this one galaxy or two? This question came to light in 1950 when astronomer [Arthur Hoag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Allen_Hoag) chanced upon this unusual extragalactic object. On the outside is a [ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap051022.html) dominated by bright blue stars, while near the center lies a ball of much redder stars that are likely much older. Between the two is a [gap](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040702.html) that appears almost completely dark. How [Hoag's Object](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJ...348..448W/abstract) formed, including its nearly [perfectly round ring](https://youtu.be/LvpCX89lHvU) of stars and gas, remains unknown. Genesis hypotheses include a [galaxy collision](https://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Struck/frames.html) billions of years ago and the gravitational effect of a [central bar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080622.html) that has [since vanished](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010CeMDA.108...23F/). The [featured photo](https://www.astrobin.com/skeebg/D/?nc=user) was taken by the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010806.html) and reprocessed using an [artificially intelligent de-noising algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Image_Prior). Observations in [radio waves](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves) indicate that [Hoag's Object](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435..475B/) has _not_ accreted a smaller galaxy in the past billion years. [Hoag's Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoag%27s_Object) spans about 100,000 [light years](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) and lies about 600 million [light years](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html) away toward the [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/) of the Snake ([Serpens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpens_(constellation))). Many galaxies far in the distance are visible toward the right, while [coincidentally](https://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/252026/slide_252026_1551499_free.jpg), visible in the gap at about seven o'clock, is another but more distant [ring galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150419.html).
