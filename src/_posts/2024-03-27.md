Almost every object in the [featured photograph](https://www.astrobin.com/vw7kj8/) is a galaxy. The [Coma Cluster of Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Cluster) pictured here is one of the densest [clusters](https://pages.astronomy.ua.edu/white/mug/cluster/clusters.html) known - it contains thousands of [galaxies](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/galaxies/). Each of [these galaxies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh7aS5__b4k) houses billions of stars - just as our own [Milky Way Galaxy](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/milkyway1.html) does. Although nearby when compared to most other [clusters](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/clusters_of_galaxies.html), light from the [Coma Cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080616.html) still takes hundreds of millions of years to reach us. In fact, the [Coma Cluster](http://www.wikisky.org/?object=Coma+Cluster&zoom=9&img_source=DSS2) is so big it takes light [millions of years](https://as1.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/05/52/68/44/1000_F_552684469_T6aPsjdMrfgOjn45o65VcmTDn7InQufD.jpg) just to go from one side to the other. Most galaxies in [Coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Berenices) and other clusters are [ellipticals](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/elliptical_galaxies.html), while most [galaxies](http://www.galaxyzoo.org/) outside of clusters are [spirals](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240101.html). The nature of [Coma's X-ray emission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Cluster#X-ray_source) is [still being investigated](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A%26A...357...66D/abstract).
