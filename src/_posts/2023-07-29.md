Bright sunlight glints as long dark shadows mark this image of the [surface of the Moon](https://www.facebook.com/people/Apollo-Lunar-Surface-Journal/100057623282572/). It was taken [fifty-four](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/about/history/jsc50/as11-40-5875.html) years ago, July 20, 1969, by Apollo 11 astronaut [Neil Armstrong](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230722.html), the first to walk on the lunar surface. [Pictured is](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/images11.html#5872) the mission's lunar module, the Eagle, and spacesuited lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin. Aldrin is unfurling a long sheet of foil also known as the [Solar Wind Composition Experiment](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1969-059C-02). Exposed facing the Sun, the foil trapped particles streaming outward in the solar wind, catching a sample of [material from the Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/genesis/in-depth/) itself. Along with moon rocks and lunar soil samples, the solar wind collector was returned for analysis in earthbound laboratories.
