What if Saturn disappeared? Sometimes, it does. It doesn't really go away, though, it just disappears from view when our [Moon moves in front](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AtMXEviIa0). Such a Saturnian eclipse, more formally called an [occultation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation), was visible along a [long swath of Earth](https://in-the-sky.org/news.php?id=20240821_16_100) -- from [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru), across the Atlantic Ocean, to [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) -- only a few days ago. The [featured color image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/astrobreda/53938042146/in/pool-apods/) is a digital fusion of the clearest images captured during [the event](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-8M5VuS_2o/) and rebalanced for color and relative brightness between the relatively dim Saturn and the comparatively bright Moon. [Saturn](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/) and the [comparative bright Moon](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fxr8mg5nunzj91.jpg). The exposures were all taken from [Breda](https://youtu.be/DCv5p4nB3bw), [Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain), just before occultation. [Eclipses](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap020222.html) of Saturn by [our Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/) will occur each month for the rest of this year. Each time, though, the fleeting event will be visible only to those with clear skies -- and the right location on [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html).
