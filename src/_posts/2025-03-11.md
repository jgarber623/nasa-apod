Many spiral galaxies have bars across their centers. Even our own [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) is thought to have a [modest central bar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050825.html). Prominently barred spiral galaxy NGC 1672, [featured here](https://esahubble.org/images/potw2445a/), was captured in spectacular detail in an image taken by the orbiting [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/about-hubble/). Visible are dark filamentary [dust lanes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060219.html), young [clusters](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/open_clusters.html) of bright blue stars, red [emission nebulas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/emission_nebulae.html) of glowing hydrogen gas, a long bright bar of [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/) across the center, and a bright [active nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus) that likely houses a supermassive [black hole](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html). Light takes about 60 million years to reach us from [NGC 1672](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1672), which spans about 75,000 [light years](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) across. [NGC 1672](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGuct0CGHiA), which appears toward the constellation of the Dolphinfish ([Dorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorado)), has [been studied](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...734...33J/abstract) to find out how a spiral bar contributes to star formation in a galaxy's central regions.
