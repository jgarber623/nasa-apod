Like a ship plowing through cosmic seas, [runaway star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061124.html) Zeta Ophiuchi produces the arcing interstellar bow wave or [bow shock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rGz862VPRo) seen in this stunning infrared portrait. In the false-color view, bluish Zeta Oph, a star about 20 times more massive than the Sun, lies near the center of the frame, moving toward the left at 24 kilometers per _second_. Its strong stellar wind precedes it, compressing and heating the dusty [interstellar material](http://espg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html) and shaping the curved shock front. What set this star in motion? Zeta Oph was likely once a member of a [binary star system](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970219.html), its companion star was more massive and hence shorter lived. When the companion [exploded as a supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova) catastrophically losing mass, Zeta Oph was flung out of the system. About 460 light-years away, [Zeta Oph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Ophiuchi) is 65,000 times more luminous than [the Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/) and would be one of the brighter stars in the sky if it weren't surrounded by obscuring [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html). The image spans about 1.5 degrees or 12 light-years at the estimated distance of [Zeta Ophiuchi](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/zetaoph.html). In January 2020, NASA placed the [Spitzer Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/main/index.html) in safe mode, ending its 16 [successful years](http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/2195-ssc2019-15-Sixteen-Images-for-Spitzer-s-Sweet-16) of [exploring the cosmos](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/goddard/nasas-spitzer-tess-find-potentially-volcano-covered-earth-size-world/).
