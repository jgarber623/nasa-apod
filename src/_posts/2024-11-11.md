What created an unusual dark streak in Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas's tail? Some images of the [bright comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_\(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS\)) during mid-October not only caught its [impressively long tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241007.html) and its [thin anti-tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241021.html), but a rather unexpected feature: a [dark](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=539576478770934) [streak](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=535555052506410) [in](https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=216720) [the](https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=216512) [long tail](https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=216118). The reason for the dark streak is currently unclear and a topic of some debate. Possible reasons include a [plume](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170416.html) of dark [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_dust), different parts of the [bright tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220112.html) being unusually superposed, and a [shadow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240211.html) of a dense part of the [coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_\(comet\)) on smaller dust particles. The streak is visible in the [featured](https://www.astrobin.com/znqqs1/) [image](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/undefined) taken on October 14 from Texas, USA. To help future analyses, if you have taken a good image of the comet that clearly shows this dark streak, please [send it in](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/apsubmit2015.html) to [APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html). Comet [Tsuchinshanâ€“ATLAS](https://theskylive.com/how-bright-is-c2023a3) has now [faded considerably](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JzqhuEDTRfCZKMKHUxPySB-1200-80.jpg) and is returning to the outer [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/solar-system-facts/).
