[Sculpted by](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080313.html) stellar winds and radiation, a magnificent interstellar dust cloud by chance has assumed this [recognizable shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seahorse). Fittingly named the [Horsehead Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsehead_Nebula), it is some 1,500 light-years [distant](https://youtu.be/hgTrLozRj40), embedded in the vast [Orion cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070125.html) complex. About five light-years "tall," the dark cloud is cataloged as [Barnard 33](http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/b33.html) and is visible only because its [obscuring dust is silhouetted](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html) against the glowing red emission nebula IC 434. [Stars are forming](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/) within the dark cloud. [Contrasting](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160608.html) blue reflection nebula NGC 2023, surrounding a hot, young [star](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve), is at the lower left of [the full image](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1912/Horsehead_Hanson_2604.jpg). The featured gorgeous [color image](https://www.hansonastronomy.com/ic-434ngc2023) combines both [narrowband](https://www.thepoke.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pets-vs-furniture-cat-squeezed-in-couch.jpg) and [broadband](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e1/6c/e4/e16ce47242406ac2d278f10619282d13.jpg) images recorded using several different telescopes.
