Beautiful island universe [Messier 94 lies](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-94/) a mere 15 million light-years distant in the northern constellation of the hunting dogs, [Canes Venatici](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canes_Venatici). A popular target for earth-based astronomers, the face-on spiral galaxy is about 30,000 light-years across, with spiral arms sweeping through the [outskirts of its](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100114.html) broad disk. But this [Hubble Space Telescope field of view](http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1542a) spans about 7,000 light-years or so across M94's central region. The sharp close-up examines the galaxy's compact, bright nucleus and prominent inner dust lanes, surrounded by a remarkable bluish ring of young, massive stars. The massive stars in the ring [appear](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_lookback.html) to be less than about 10 million years old, indicating the galaxy experienced a corresponding well-defined era of rapid star formation. As a result, while the small, bright nucleus is typical of the [Seyfert](http://spider.seds.org/spider/ScholarX/seyferts.html) class of active galaxies, M94 is also known as a [starburst galaxy](http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/starburst.html). Because M94 is relatively nearby, astronomers can explore [in detail](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0011101) reasons for the galaxy's burst of star formation.
