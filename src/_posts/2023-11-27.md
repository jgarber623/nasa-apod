This [eagle ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_ray) [glides](https://youtu.be/sHgPqrBF8bA) across a cosmic sea. Officially cataloged as [SH2-63 and LBN 86](https://www.astrobin.com/qa64zs/), the dark nebula is composed of gas and dust that just happens to appear shaped like a [common ocean fish](https://www.georgiaaquarium.org/animal/spotted-eagle-ray/). The [interstellar dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990509.html) nebula appears light brown as it [blocks](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html) and [reddens](http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/StarProp/dust.html) visible light emitted behind it. Dark nebulas glow primarily in [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/), but also reflect [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) from surrounding stars. The dust in dark nebulas is usually sub-millimeter chunks of [carbon, silicon, and oxygen](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230108.html), frequently coated with frozen [carbon monoxide](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/global-maps/MOP_CO_M) and [nitrogen](https://youtu.be/qVKod6Rv6dE). Dark nebulas are also known as [molecular clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231123.html) because they also contain relatively high amounts of [molecular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomic_molecule) [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) and [larger molecules](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120821.html). Previously unnamed, the here dubbed [Eagle Ray](https://youtu.be/sHgPqrBF8bA) Nebula is normally [quite dim](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1326946398/photo/curious-dog-funny-pug-looking-through-binoculars.jpg?s=1024x1024&w=is&k=20&c=daD-I9x7Ukt1qUsyqChchDFUt6vaI5vfvswI3dzJCUM=) but has been imaged clearly over 20-hours through [dark skies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200408.html) in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile).
