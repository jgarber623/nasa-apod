These chaotic and tangled filaments of shocked, glowing gas are spread across planet Earth's sky toward the constellation of Cygnus as part of the [Veil Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220622.html). The [Veil Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_Nebula) itself is a large [supernova remnant](https://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html), an expanding cloud born of the death explosion of a massive star. Light from the original supernova explosion likely reached Earth over 5,000 years ago. The [glowing filaments](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AJ....122..938D/abstract) are really more like long ripples in a sheet seen almost edge on, remarkably well separated into the glow of ionized hydrogen atoms shown in red and oxygen in blue hues. Also known as the [Cygnus Loop](https://youtu.be/3MJChWEmtUw) and cataloged as [NGC 6979](https://youtu.be/vk0_PYyzvm8), the [Veil Nebula now spans](http://archive.stsci.edu/fuse/scisumm/sci_cyglpstar.html) about 6 times the diameter of the [full Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140113.html). The length of the wisp corresponds to about 30 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/), given its estimated distance of 2,400 light years. Often identified as Pickering's Triangle for a director of [Harvard College Observatory](https://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Observatory/newest.html), it is perhaps better named for its discoverer, [astronomer Williamina Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamina_Fleming), as [Fleming's Triangular Wisp](http://www.davidcortner.com/slowblog/20161113.php).
