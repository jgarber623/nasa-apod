The Crab Nebula is cataloged as M1, the first object on [Charles Messier's](https://www.nasa.gov/content/explore-the-night-sky-hubble-s-messier-catalog-bio) famous 18th century list of things which are not comets. In fact, [the Crab](http://messier.seds.org/more/m001_rosse.html) is now known to be a [supernova remnant](https://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html), debris from the death explosion of a massive star [witnessed by astronomers](http://messier.seds.org/more/m001_sn.html) in the year 1054. This sharp image from the [James Webb Space Telescopeâ€™s](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2023/137/01HBBMDH12APPEGB8DXVVEP8XA?news=true) NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) explores the eerie glow and fragmented strands of the still [expanding cloud of interstellar debris](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/videos/2023/137/01HDS5S3XBRCK1KNRH67WW2HPW) in infrared light. One of the most exotic objects known to modern astronomers, [the Crab Pulsar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01617), a neutron star spinning 30 times a second, is visible as a bright spot near the nebula's center. [Like a cosmic dynamo](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180317.html), this collapsed remnant of the stellar core powers the Crab's emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. Spanning about 12 light-years, the Crab Nebula is a mere 6,500 light-years away in the head-strong [constellation Taurus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211022.html).
