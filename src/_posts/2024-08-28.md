When can you see a black hole, a tulip, and a swan all at once? At night -- if the timing is right, and if your telescope is pointed in the [right direction](https://skywiseunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/scoper_05.jpg). The complex and beautiful [Tulip Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh_2-101) blossoms about 8,000 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) away toward the [constellation of Cygnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_\(constellation\)) the Swan. [Ultraviolet radiation](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/) from young energetic stars at the edge of the Cygnus [OB3 association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_kinematics#OB_associations), including [O star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070726.html) HDE 227018, ionizes the atoms and powers the emission from the Tulip Nebula. [Stewart Sharpless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Sharpless) cataloged this nearly 70 light-years across reddish glowing cloud of interstellar gas and dust in [1959](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1959ApJS....4..257S/abstract), as [Sh2-101](http://galaxymap.org/cat/list/sharpless/101). Also in the [featured field](https://www.astrobin.com/3y9228/) of view is the black hole [Cygnus X-1](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2011/cygx1/), which to be a [microquasar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microquasar) because it is one of strongest [X-ray](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays/) sources in planet Earth's sky. Blasted by powerful jets from a [lurking black hole](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/2259/devoured-by-gravity-poster/?galaxy_horror), its fainter bluish curved [shock front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave) is only faintly visible [beyond](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090608.html) the cosmic Tulip's petals, near the right side of the frame.
