This timelapse series captured on October 14 is set against the sunrise view from Sunset Point, [Bryce Canyon, planet Earth](https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/2023-annular-eclipse.htm). Of course on that date the New Moon caught up with the Sun in the canyon's morning skies. Local temperatures fell as the Moon's [shadow swept](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/the-moons-shadow-darkens-a-portion-of-the-earths-surface/) across the high altitude scene and the brilliant morning sunlight became a more subdued yellow hue cast over the reddish rocky landscape. In the timelapse series, images were taken at 2 minute intervals. The camera and solar filter were fixed to a tripod to follow the phases of the [annular solar eclipse](https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/tag/eclipse/).
