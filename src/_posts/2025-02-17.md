What's happened to the sky? Last Monday, the photogenic launch plume from a [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com/) [rocket launch](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170122.html) created [quite a spectacle](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9e/b7/32/9eb732bacf6acde3c844e7c1d1c5aa5b.jpg) over parts of southern [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California#/media/File:California_in_United_States.svg) and [Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona#/media/File:Arizona_in_United_States.svg). Looking at times like a [giant space fish](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240501.html), the impressive rocket launch from [Vandenberg Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg_Air_Force_Base) near [Lompoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lompoc,_California), California, was so bright because it was [backlit](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120208.html) by the setting Sun. The [Falcon 9](http://www.spacex.com/falcon9) rocket successfully [delivered](https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/spacex-launches-23-starlink-satellites-to-orbit-from-california-photos) to [low Earth orbit](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-orbit-58.html) 23 Starlink communications satellites. The [plume](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240211.html) from the first stage is seen on the right, while the [soaring](https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/hxr5yl/psbattle_this_jumping_cat/#lightbox) upper stage rocket is seen at the apex of the [plume](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150524.html) toward the left. Venus appears at the top of the frame, while a bright streetlight shines on the far right. The featured image was captured toward the west after sunset from near [Phoenix](https://youtu.be/_trT55K4JIs), Arizona.
