In the upper left corner, surrounded by blue arms and dotted with red nebulas, is spiral galaxy [M81](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250327.html). In the lower right corner, marked by a light central line and surrounded by red glowing gas, is irregular galaxy [M82](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230802.html). This [stunning vista](https://www.astrobin.com/m6cjk0/) shows these two mammoth galaxies locked in [gravitational combat](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30468/), as they have been for the past billion years. The gravity from each galaxy [dramatically affects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_merger) the other during each hundred-million-year pass. Last go-round, [M82](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060414.html)'s gravity likely raised density waves rippling around [M81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_81), resulting in the richness of [M81](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Sw0axqIBM)'s spiral arms. But M81 left [M82](http://messier.seds.org/m/m082.html) with violent star forming regions and colliding gas clouds so energetic the galaxy [glows in X-rays](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2000/0094/index.html). This big battle is [seen from Earth](http://www.iqtrivia.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/animals-looking-through-the-window-201.jpg) through the faint glow of an [Integrated Flux Nebula](https://www.spacetelescope.org/projects/fits_liberator/fitsimages/rogelio_bernal_andreo_1/), a little studied complex of diffuse gas and dust clouds in our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/). In a few billion years, only one galaxy [will remain](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap041121.html).
