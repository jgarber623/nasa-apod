One year ago [a Space Launch System rocket left planet Earth](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/liftoff-nasa-s-artemis-i-mega-rocket-launches-orion-to-moon) on November 16, 2022 at 1:47am EST carrying the Orion spacecraft on the Artemis I mission, the first integrated test of NASA’s deep space exploration systems. Over an hour after [liftoff from](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto/sets/72177720297400430/) Kennedy Space Center's [historic](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/55-years-ago-apollo-4-the-first-flight-of-the-saturn-v) Launch Complex 39B, one of Orion's [external video cameras](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-artemis-i-cameras-to-offer-new-views-of-orion-earth-moon) captured this view of its new [perspective from space](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasa2explore/albums/72177720303788800). In the foreground are Orion's Orbital Maneuvering System engine and auxillary engines, at the bottom of the European Service Module. Beyond one of the module's 7-meter long extended solar array wings lies the spacecraft's [beautiful home](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/) world. Making close flybys of the lunar surface and reaching a retrograde orbit 70,000 kilometers beyond the Moon, the [uncrewed Artemis I mission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-i/) lasted over 25 days, testing capabilities to enable human exploration of the Moon and Mars. Building on the [success of Artemis I](https://moon.nasa.gov/resources/530/nasas-artemis-i-moon-mission-launch-to-splashdown-highlights/), no earlier than November 2024 [the Artemis II mission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/) with a crew of 4 will venture around the Moon and back again.
