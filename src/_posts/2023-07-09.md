Eta Carinae may be about to explode. But no one knows when - it may be next year, it may be one million years from now. [Eta Carinae](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap991011.html)'s mass - about 100 times greater than our [Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/sun.html) - makes it an excellent candidate for a full blown [supernova](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/supernovae2.html). Historical records do show that about 170 years ago [Eta Carinae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Carinae) underwent an unusual outburst that made it one of the [brightest stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars#Table) in the [southern sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000618.html). [Eta Carinae](http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/etacar.html), in the [Keyhole Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160814.html), is the only [star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaBxMo4b74g) currently [thought to emit natural LASER light](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap971129.html). This [featured image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/32019832757/) brings out details in the [unusual nebula](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpnhCEqcRvY) that surrounds [this rogue star](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ARA%26A..35....1D/abstract). [Diffraction spikes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010415.html), caused by the telescope, are visible as bright multi-colored streaks emanating from Eta Carinae's center. Two distinct lobes of the [Homunculus Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140717.html) encompass the [hot central region](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...445L.121C/abstract), while some strange radial streaks are visible in red extending toward the image right. The lobes are [filled](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7184) with lanes of gas and [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html) which absorb the blue and [ultraviolet light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) emitted near the center. The streaks, however, remain [unexplained](http://en.bcdn.biz/Images/2016/6/22/2617d6e7-4f6a-4c46-9020-c3aee00f3c79.jpg).
