Could there be a tornado inside another tornado? In general, no. OK, but could there be a tornado inside a wider [dust devil](https://youtu.be/4aswtt6Cobo)? No again, for one [reason because](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/78oaoc/is_there_a_fundamental_difference_between/) tornados comes down from the sky, but dust devils [rise up](https://assets.puzzlefactory.com/puzzle/502/800/original.webp) from the ground. What is pictured is a [landspout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landspout), an unusual type of tornado known to occur on the edge of a violent [thunderstorm](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220116.html). The [featured landspout](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9SdnFAJpWU/) was imaged and identified in [Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), in June 2019 by an experienced storm chaser. The [real tornado](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1136196520169464&set=a.205174699938322) is in the center, and the outer sheath was possibly created by [large dust particles thrown out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/08/tall-tornado-denver-colorado/) from the central tornado. So far, the only planet known to create tornados is [Earth](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-earth/), although [tornado-like activity](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/11691/) has been [found](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap980429.html) on the Sun and [dust devils](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150303.html) are common on [Mars](https://mars.nasa.gov/).
