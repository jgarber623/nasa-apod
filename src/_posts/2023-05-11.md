[Fomalhaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomalhaut) is a bright star, a 25 light-year [voyage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocannon%27s_World) from planet Earth in the direction of the constellation [Piscis Austrinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piscis_Austrinus). Astronomers first [noticed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap980423.html) Fomalhaut's excess infrared emission in the 1980s. Space and ground-based telescopes [have since](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050701.html) identified the infrared emission's source as a disk of dusty debris, [evidence for](https://www.adamblockphotos.com/fomalhaut-debris-disk.html) a planetary system surrounding the hot, young star. [But this sharp infrared image](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-109) from the James Webb Space Telescope's MIRI camera reveals details of Fomalhaut's debris disk never before seen, including a large dust cloud in the outer ring that is possible evidence for colliding bodies, and an inner dust disk and gap likely shaped and maintained by embedded but unseen planets. [An image scale bar in au](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2023/109/01GWWHHHT27VZEQ5D1MK6EHD46) or astronomical units, the average Earth-Sun distance, appears at the lower left. Fomalhaut's outer circumstellar dust ring lies at about twice the distance of our own Solar System's [Kuiper Belt](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/overview/) of small icy bodies and debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.
