Can you find the Rosette Nebula? The large, [red](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240209.html), and flowery-looking nebula on the upper left may seem the obvious choice, but that is actually just diffuse [hydrogen](https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2016/ps_5.html) emission surrounding the [Cone and Fox Fur Nebulas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190416.html). The famous [Rosette Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210214.html) is really located on the lower right and connected to the [other nebulas](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/multimedia/name-that-nebula/) by irregular filaments. Because the [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/ei16px/) of Rosetta's field is so [wide and deep](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240123.html), it seems to contain other flowers. Designated [NGC 2237](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960214.html), the center of the Rosette nebula is populated by the bright blue stars of open cluster [NGC 2244](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210221.html), whose winds and [energetic light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/) are evacuating the nebula's center. The [Rosette Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosette_Nebula) is about 5,000 light years distant and, just by itself, [spans](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1170788665/photo/jumping-cat.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=ZvO4j-SI87tsFolx95wXRSr1JTRIz74ONyotWGSi5Ww=) about three times the diameter of a [full moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html). This flowery field can be found toward the [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/) of the [Unicorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn) ([Monoceros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoceros)).
