History's second known periodic comet is [Comet Encke (2P/Encke)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Encke). As it swings through the inner [Solar System, Encke's](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/2p-encke/) orbit takes it from an aphelion, its greatest distance from the Sun, inside the orbit of Jupiter to a perihelion just inside the orbit of Mercury. Returning to its perihelion every 3.3 years, Encke has the shortest [period of the Solar System's major comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numbered_comets). Comet Encke is also associated with ([at least](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...605A..68S/abstract)) two annual meteor showers on planet Earth, the [North and South Taurids](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/taurid-meteors-all-you-need-to-know/). Both showers are active in late October and early November. Their two separate radiants lie near bright star Aldebaran in the head-strong constellation Taurus. A faint comet, Encke was captured in [this telescopic field of view](https://www.astrobin.com/jurom7/C/) imaged on the morning of August 24. Then, Encke's pretty greenish coma was close on the sky to the young, embedded star cluster and light-years long, [tadpole-shaped](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200618.html) star-forming clouds in emission nebula IC 410. [Now near bright star Spica](https://theskylive.com/encke-info) in Virgo Comet Encke passed its 2023 perihelion only five days ago, on October 22.
