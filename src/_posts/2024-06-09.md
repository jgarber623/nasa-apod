What is that light in the sky? The answer to one of humanity's more common questions may emerge from a few quick observations. For example -- is it moving or blinking? If so, and if you live near a [city](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200624.html), the answer is typically an airplane, since planes are so numerous and so few stars and [satellites](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080604.html) are bright enough to be seen over the glare of [artificial city lights](https://darksky.org/what-we-do/international-dark-sky-places/). If not, and if you live far from a city, that bright light is likely a planet such as [Venus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210317.html) or [Mars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180709.html) -- the former of which is constrained to appear near the horizon just before dawn or after dusk. Sometimes the low apparent motion of a distant [airplane](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190212.html) near the horizon makes it hard to tell from a [bright planet](http://earthsky.org/space/why-dont-planets-twinkle-as-stars-do), but even this can usually be discerned by the plane's motion over a few minutes. [Still unsure?](http://img.youtube.com/vi/9uuqXXT7VYo/hqdefault.jpg) The [featured chart](http://www.leagueoflostcauses.com/blog/2013/08/astronomy-101.html) gives a sometimes-humorous but mostly-accurate assessment. Dedicated sky enthusiasts will likely note -- and are [encouraged to provide](http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=211114) -- polite corrections.
