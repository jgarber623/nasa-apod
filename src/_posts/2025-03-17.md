Thor not only has [his own day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday#Thor's_day) (Thursday), but a helmet in the heavens. Popularly called Thor's Helmet, [NGC 2359](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_2359) is a hat-shaped cosmic cloud with wing-like appendages. Heroically sized even for a [Norse god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor), Thor's Helmet is about 30 light-years across. In fact, the cosmic head-covering is more like [an interstellar bubble](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180419.html), blown by a fast wind from the bright, massive star near the bubble's center. Known as a [Wolf-Rayet star](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/a-wolf-rayet-bubble-and-the-early-solar-system/), the central star is an extremely [hot giant](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250203.html) thought to be in a brief, pre-[supernova](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050910.html) stage of [evolution](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/infographics/stellar-evolution). NGC 2359 [is located](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250218.html) about 15,000 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) away toward the constellation of the [Great Overdog](https://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~hsg/134/poems/frost-canis-major.txt). This [sharp image](https://www.astrobin.com/5bo4w1/B/) is a mixed cocktail of data from [narrowband filters](https://astrobackyard.com/narrowband-imaging/), capturing not only [natural looking](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Nf3-uFj0L.__AC_SY445_SX342_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg) stars but details of [the nebula's](https://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/118/2/948) filamentary structures. The [star in the center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WR_7) of Thor's Helmet is expected to [explode](https://youtu.be/i_PCaRn2xoE) in a spectacular [supernova sometime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet_star#Supernovae) within the next few thousand years.
