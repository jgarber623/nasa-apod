[Earth's orbit around the Sun](https://earthsky.org/tonight/earth-comes-closest-to-sun-every-year-in-early-january/) is not a circle, it's an ellipse. The point along its elliptical orbit where our fair planet is [closest to the Sun](https://blogs.nasa.gov/parkersolarprobe/2024/01/08/nasas-parker-solar-probe-completes-18th-close-approach-to-the-sun/) is called perihelion. This year, perihelion was on January 2 at 01:00 UTC, with the Earth about 3 million [miles](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201003.html) closer to the Sun than it was at aphelion (last July 6), the farthest point in its elliptical orbit. Of course, distance from the Sun [doesn't determine the seasons](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/december-solstice-january-perihelion-related/), and it doesn't the determine size of Sun halos. [Easier to see](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231014.html) with the Sun hidden behind a tall tree trunk, this beautiful ice halo forms a 22 degree-wide circle around the Sun, recorded while strolling through the countryside near Heroldstatt, Germany. The Sun halo's 22 degree angular diameter is [determined by the six-sided geometry](https://atoptics.co.uk/blog/22-halo-formation/) of water ice crystals drifting high in planet Earth's atmosphere.
