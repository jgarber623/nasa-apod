The night side of Pluto spans [this shadowy scene](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20727). In the stunning spacebased perspective the Sun is 4.9 billion kilometers (almost 4.5 light-hours) behind the dim and distant world. It was captured by far flung [New Horizons in July of 2015](http://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-best-close-up-of-plutos-surface) when the spacecraft was at a range of some 21,000 kilometers from Pluto, about 19 minutes after its closest approach. A denizen [of the Kuiper Belt](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/overview/) in dramatic silhouette, the image also reveals Pluto's tenuous, surprisingly [complex layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05356) of hazy atmosphere. Near the top of the frame the crescent [twilight landscape](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210115.html) includes southern areas of nitrogen ice plains now formally known as [Sputnik Planitia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_Planitia) and [rugged mountains](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150718.html) of water-ice in the Norgay Montes.
