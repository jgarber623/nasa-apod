Do any shapes seem to jump out at you from this interstellar field of stars and dust? The [jeweled](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191013.html) expanse, filled with faint, starlight-reflecting clouds, drifts through the night in the royal constellation of [Cepheus](https://www.dibonsmith.com/cep_con.htm). Far from your own neighborhood on planet [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/), these [ghostly apparition](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/eb/62/1a/eb621ac58b9948269119f140ca2f8feb.jpg)s lurk along the plane of the Milky Way at the edge of the [Cepheus Flare](http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4761) molecular cloud complex some 1,200 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) away. Over two [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/)s across and brighter than the other spooky [chimera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology))s, [VdB 141 or Sh2-136](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Nebula) is also known as the [Ghost Nebula](https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-vdb141/), seen toward the bottom of the [featured image](http://www.astrobogdan.pl/nebulae/vdb-141-the-ghost-nebula-in-cepheus/). Within the [reflection nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_nebula) are the telltale signs of dense cores [collapsing](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/a-ghostly-trio-from-nasas-spitzer-space-telescope) in the early [stages](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJS..185..451K/abstract) of star formation.
