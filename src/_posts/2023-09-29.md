[Back from asteroid 101955 Bennu](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-first-asteroid-sample-has-landed-now-secure-in-clean-room), a 110-pound, 31-inch wide sample return capsule rests in a [desert on planet Earth](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151863/osiris-rex-prepares-to-return-asteroid-sample) in this photo, taken at the Department of Defense Utah Test and Training Range near Salt Lake City [last Sunday, September 24](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto/albums/72177720311435828/with/53210883020/). Dropped off by the OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft, the capsule looks charred from the extreme temperatures experienced during its blistering descent through Earth's dense atmosphere. OSIRIS-Rex began its home-ward journey from Bennu in May of 2021. Delivered to NASAâ€™s Johnson Space Center in Houston on September 25, the capsule's canister is expected to contain an uncontaminated sample of about a half pound (250 grams) of [Bennu's loosely packed regolith](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230921.html). Working in a new laboratory designed for the OSIRIS-REx mission, scientists and engineers will complete the [canister disassembly process](https://blogs.nasa.gov/osiris-rex/2023/09/26/the-osiris-rex-sample-canister-lid-is-removed/), and plan to unveil the sample of [the near-Earth asteroid](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/101955-bennu/overview/) in a broadcast event on October 11.
