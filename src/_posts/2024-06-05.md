What if you saw your shadow on Mars and it wasn't human? Then you might be the [Perseverance rover](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210220.html) exploring [Mars](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/). Perseverance has been examining the Red Planet since 2021, [finding evidence](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/science-highlights/) of its complex [history of volcanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanism_on_Mars) and [ancient flowing water](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/mars-2020-perseverance/perseverance-rover/nasas-perseverance-rover-deciphers-ancient-history-of-martian-lake/), and sending [breathtaking images](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210226.html) across the inner [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/facts/). [Pictured here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nev-t/53745626975/in/pool-apods/) in February of 2024, [Perseverance looks](https://www.gigapan.com/gigapans/234863) opposite the Sun and across Neretva Vallis in [Jezero Crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezero_\(crater\)), with a [local hill visible](https://www.flickr.com/photos/thomasappere/53562328685/in/photostream/) at the top of the frame. The distinctively non-human shadow of the [car-sized rover](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/rover-components/) is visible below center, superposed on [scattered rocks](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap991030.html). Perseverance, now working [without](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240210.html) its flying companion [Ingenuity](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210701.html), continues [to search](https://www.ardeaprints.com/p/172/cat-black-white-cat-garden-looking-plant-3749006.jpg.webp) Mars for [signs of ancient life](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1763/the-hunt-for-life-on-mars-and-elsewhere-in-the-solar-system/).
