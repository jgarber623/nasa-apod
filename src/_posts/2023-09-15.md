[Venus has returned](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/home/), now appearing in planet Earth's predawn skies as a [brilliant morning star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230826.html). From a window seat on a flight to Mexico City, the bright celestial beacon was captured just before sunrise in this astronomical snapshot, taken on September 12. Venus, at the upper right, shared the early twilight with an [old crescent Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210710.html). Seen from this stratospheric perspective, mountain peaks and clouds appear in silhouette along a glowing eastern horizon. The dramatic, long, low cloud bank was created by ongoing venting from planet Earth's active volcano [Popocatépetl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popocat%C3%A9petl).
