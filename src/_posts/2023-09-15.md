[Venus has returned](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/home/) as a [brilliant morning star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230826.html). From a window seat on a flight to Mexico City, the bright celestial beacon was captured just before sunrise in this astronomical snapshot, taken on September 12. Venus, at the upper right, shared the early predawn skies with an [old crescent Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210710.html). Seen from this stratospheric perspective, both mountain peaks and clouds appear in silhouette along a glowing eastern horizon. The dramatic, long, low cloud bank was created by venting from planet Earth's active volcano [Popocatépetl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popocat%C3%A9petl).
