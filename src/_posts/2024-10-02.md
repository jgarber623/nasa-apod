It is the largest satellite galaxy of our home Milky Way Galaxy. If you live in the south, the [Large Magellanic Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Magellanic_Cloud) (LMC) is [quite noticeable](https://media.gettyimages.com/id/113908644/photo/surprised-cat.jpg?s=612x612&w=gi&k=20&c=gPFFKQ1xzY0GzfMeq-z5GG6bWVwyi3a_R07RKOKijI4=), spanning about 10 degrees across the night sky, which is 20 times larger than the [full moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200925.html) towards the southern constellation of the [dolphinfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coryphaena) ([Dorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorado)). Being only about 160,000 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) away, many details of the LMC's structure can be seen, such as its [central bar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180516.html) and its single spiral arm. The LMC harbors numerous stellar nurseries where new stars are being born, which appear in pink in the [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/full/b3se4j/). It is home to the [Tarantula Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240308.html), the currently most active star forming region in the entire [Local Group](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/localgr.html), a small collection of nearby galaxies dominated by the massive [Andromeda](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200925.html) and [Milky Way](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) galaxies. Studies of the LMC and the [Small Magellanic Cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210105.html) (SMC) by [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000903.html) led to the discovery of the period-luminosity relationship of [Cepheid](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/cepheids.html) variable stars that are used to [measure distances](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231006.html) across the nearby [universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220316.html).
