Viewed face-on, grand spiral galaxy NGC 5643 has a [festive appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYMTXZ1a2NU&t=10s) in this [colorful cosmic portrait](https://esahubble.org/images/potw2450a/). Some 55 million light-years distant, the galaxy extends for over 100,000 light-years, seen within the boundaries of the southern constellation Lupus. Its [inner 40,000 light-years](https://esahubble.org/videos/potw2450a/) are shown in sharp detail in this composite of Hubble Space Telescope image data. The galaxy's magnificent spiral arms wind from a yellowish central region dominated by light from old stars, while the spiral arms themselves are traced by dust lanes, young blue stars and [reddish](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050930.html) star forming regions. The bright compact core of NGC 5643 is also known as a strong emitter of [radio waves](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves) and [X-rays](http://chandra.harvard.edu/learn_light.html). In fact, NGC 5643 is one of the closest examples of the [Seyfert class](http://www.seyfertgalaxies.com/) of active galaxies, where vast amounts of dust and gas are thought to be falling into a central massive [black hole](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/black-holes/en/).
