In a photo from the early hours of July 29 (UTC), a Redstone rocket and Mercury capsule are on display at Cape Canaveral [Launch Complex 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Launch_Complex_5). Beyond the Redstone, the 8 minute long exposure has captured the arcing launch streak of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. [The Falcon's heavy](https://spaceflightnow.com/2023/07/29/falcon-heavy-launches-heaviest-commercial-communications-satellite-yet/) communications satellite payload, at a record setting 9 metric tons, is bound for [geosynchronous orbit](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/chapter5-1/) some 22,000 miles above planet Earth. [The historic launch](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210507.html) of a Redstone rocket carried astronaut [Alan Shepard](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/60-years-ago-alan-shepard-becomes-the-first-american-in-space) on a suborbital spaceflight in May 1961 to an altitude of about 116 miles. Near the top of the frame, this Falcon rocket's two reusable side boosters separate and execute brief entry burns. They [returned](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180113.html) to land side by side at Canaveral's Landing Zone 1 and 2 in the distance.
