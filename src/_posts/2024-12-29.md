What are these bubbles frozen into Lake Baikal? [Methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane). Lake Baikal, a [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) [World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site) in [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia), is the world's largest (by volume), oldest, and deepest lake, containing over 20% of the world's fresh water. The lake is also a vast storehouse of methane, a [greenhouse gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect) that, if released, could potentially increase the amount of [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) light absorbed by [Earth's atmosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/), and so increase the average temperature of the [entire planet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html). Fortunately, the amount of [methane](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236143909_Sources_and_sinks_of_methane_in_Lake_Baikal_A_synthesis_of_measurements_and_modeling) currently [bubbling out](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2785/unexpected-future-boost-of-methane-possible-from-arctic-permafrost/) is not climatologically important. It is not clear [what would happen](http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2016/12/lake-baikal.html), though, were temperatures to significantly increase in [the region](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/30/siberian-craters-big-releases-of-methane-could-pose-broad-problems.html), or if the water level in [Lake Baikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal) were to drop. [Pictured](https://petapixel.com/2017/01/17/photographing-frozen-baikal-deepest-oldest-lake-earth/), bubbles of rising [methane froze](http://www.lakescientist.com/frozen-methane-gas-supports-life-lake-baikal/) during winter into the exceptionally [clear ice](https://youtu.be/r_izDyWAid4) covering the lake.
