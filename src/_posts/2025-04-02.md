Why does Jupiter have rings? [Jupiter's main ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Jupiter#Main_ring) was discovered in 1979 by NASA's passing [Voyager](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/) 1 spacecraft, but its origin was then a mystery. Data from NASA's [Galileo](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/galileo/) spacecraft that orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, however, confirmed the hypothesis that [this ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120617.html) was created by meteoroid impacts on small nearby moons. As a small meteoroid strikes tiny [Metis](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia02531-best-images-yet-of-thebe-amalthea-and-metis/), for example, it will bore into the moon, vaporize, and explode dirt and dust off into a [Jovian](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180221.html) orbit. The [featured image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/52219195378/) of Jupiter in [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) by the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/) shows not only [Jupiter and its clouds](https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/07/14/webb-images-of-jupiter-and-more-now-available-in-commissioning-data/), but this ring as well. Jupiter's [Great Red Spot](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201019.html) (GRS) -- in comparatively light color on the right, Jupiter's large moon [Europa](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/jupiter-moons/europa/) -- in the center of [diffraction spikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_spike) on the left, and [Europa's shadow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220717.html) -- next to the [GRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot) -- are also visible. Several features in the image are [not yet well understood](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/surprised-cat-picture-id154887818?k=20&m=154887818&s=612x612&w=0&h=hChPEVbyuR9J9ASBnZ0LX0RBnUuVEcBAjqKB2o3Gx-E=), including the [seemingly separated](https://twitter.com/SpaceGeck/status/1547855880061722624) cloud layer on Jupiter's right limb.
