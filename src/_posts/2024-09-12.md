[This spectacular mosaic](https://esawebb.org/images/potm2408b/) of images from the James Webb Space Telescope peers into the heart of young star cluster NGC 1333. A mere 1,000 light-years distant toward the heroic constellation [Perseus](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/per/index.html), the nearby star cluster lies at the edge of the large Perseus molecular cloud. Part of Webb's deep [exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12639) of the region to identify low mass brown dwarf stars and free floating planets, the space telescope's combined field of view spans nearly 2 light-years [across the dusty cluster's](https://esawebb.org/videos/potm2408a/) turbulent stellar nursery. In fact, NGC 1333 is known to harbor stars less than a million years old, though most are [hidden from optical telescopes](http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/224-ssc2005-24-Beautiful-Chaos-of-Star-Birth) by the [pervasive stardust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210318.html). The chaotic environment may be similar to one in which our own Sun formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
