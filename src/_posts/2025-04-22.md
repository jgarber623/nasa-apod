What's different about this Moon? It's the [terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_\(solar\))s. In the featured image, you can't directly see any [terminator](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180522.html) -- the line that divides the light of day from the dark of night. That's because the [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DIcPVpbsRO4/) is a digital composite of many near-terminator lunar strips over a full [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/). Terminator regions show the longest and most [prominent shadow](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1e/c4/a9/1ec4a9503ab9fdfaede7f3a6b93e5ba0--light-and-shadow-cat-silhouette.jpg)s -- shadows which, by their contrast and length, allow a flat photograph to appear [three-dimensional](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/gltf_embed/2366/). The overlay images were taken over two weeks in early April. Many of the Moon's [craters](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/impact-crater/) stand out because of the [shadow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211125.html)s they all cast to the right. The image shows in graphic detail that the [darker regions known as maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare#/media/File:Moon_names.svg) are not just darker than the rest of the [Moon](https://moon.nasa.gov/observe-the-moon-night/resources/moon-map/) -- they are also [flatter](https://cache.desktopnexus.com/thumbseg/154/154798-bigthumbnail.jpg).
