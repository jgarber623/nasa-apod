Does the Sun follow the same path every day? [No](https://sadanduseless.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/funny-suprised-cat2.jpg). The Sun's path changes during the year, tracing a longer route during the summer than the winter. [Pictured here](https://greenflash.photo/portfolio/la-traiettoria-del-sole-nei-giorno-dellequinozio-e-del-solstizio/), the [Sun's arc](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101221.html) was captured from noon to sunset on three days, from highest in the sky to lowest: [summer solstice](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210620.html), [equinox](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210922.html), and [winter solstice](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151231.html). The images were taken near [Gatto Corvino](https://goo.gl/maps/eSwDyTAmV6FZem2w7) Village in [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) in 2020 and 2021. The path and time the [Sun spends in the sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220321.html) is more important in [determining the season](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/) than how close the Earth is to the [Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/). In fact, the [Earth is closest](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question53.html) to the Sun in January, during northern winter. Today is a [solstice](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170621.html), so [today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice) the Sun is taking its longest path of the year across the sky in Earth's [northern hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere), but the shortest path in the [southern hemisphere](https://www.thoughtco.com/geography-of-the-southern-hemisphere-1435565).
