Why does Comet ATLAS have such colorful tails? Last week [Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_G3_\(ATLAS\)) passed its closest to the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) -- well inside the orbit of [Mercury](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190428.html) -- and brightened [dramatically](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/a47jhh/this_cat_is_happy_to_see_itself/#lightbox). Unfortunately, the comet was then so angularly near the Sun that it was very hard for [human](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190818.html)s to see. But NASA's [SOHO spacecraft](https://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/about/about.html) saw it. Pictured is a SOHO ([LASCO](https://lasco-www.nrl.navy.mil/) C3) image of [Comet ATLAS](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250113.html) that is a composite of several different color filters. Of the several tails visible, the central white tails are likely made of [dust](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/*/Cometary+Dust+Tail) and just reflecting back sunlight. The red, blue, and green tails are likely [ion tails](http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/tail.html) with their colors dominated by light emitted by specific gases that were [ejected](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151118.html) from the comet and energized by the Sun. Currently, [Comet ATLAS](https://theskylive.com/c2024g3-info) is showing [long tails](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=600057509389497) in southern skies but fading as it moves out of the [inner Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/focus-areas/inner-solar-system/).
