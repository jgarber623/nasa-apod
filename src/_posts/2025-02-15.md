Three suns seem to hug the horizon in this otherworldly winterscape. But the evocative scene was captured during a February 3rd snowmobile exploration of the mountainous region around Abisko National Park, northern Sweden, [planet Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/). The two bright spots on either side of [Earth's Sun are parhelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog) (singular parhelion), also known as mock suns or sun dogs. The parhelia are caused by [hexagonal](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2014/02/03/reader-pics-sundogs/) ice crystals [suspended](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240125.html) in the hazy atmosphere that reflect and refract sunlight. Commonly seen in winter and at high latitudes, the bright parhelia lie along the visible 22 degree [ice halo of the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231220.html).
