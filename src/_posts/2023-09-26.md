Do you see the horse's head? What you are seeing is not the famous [Horsehead nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220921.html) toward [Orion](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210509.html), but rather a fainter nebula that only takes on a [familiar form](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210704.html) with deeper imaging. The main part of the [here-imaged](https://www.galactic-hunter.com/post/ic4592) [molecular cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html) complex is [reflection nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_nebula) [IC 4592](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_4592). Reflection nebulas are made up of very fine [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html) that normally appears dark but can look quite blue when reflecting the [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight) of energetic nearby stars. In this case, the source of much of the reflected light is a star at the [eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0VJ1K93PM) of the [horse](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DYPBo1QCnls/UBAUokUjOFI/AAAAAAAAAck/gSVevljIUUc/s640/funnyface.jpg). That star is part of [Nu Scorpii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_Scorpii), one of the brighter star systems toward the constellation of the Scorpion ([Scorpius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpius)). A second [reflection nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/reflection_nebulae.html) dubbed [IC 4601](https://www.astrobin.com/iky5d6/B/) is visible surrounding [two stars](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/senior/astrophysics/binary_intro.html) above and to the right of the image center.
