History's first known periodic comet, [Comet Halley (1P/Halley)](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/1p-halley/in-depth/), returns to the inner Solar System every 76 years or so. The famous comet made its last appearance to the naked-eye in 1986. But dusty debris from Comet Halley can be seen raining through planet Earth's skies twice a year during two annual meteor showers, the [Eta Aquarids in May](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/eta-aquarids/in-depth/) and the [Orionids in October](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/orionids/in-depth/). In fact, [an unhurried series](http://www.davidcortner.com/slowblog/20231023.php) of exposures captured these two bright meteors, vaporizing bits of Halley dust, during the early morning hours of October 23 against a starry background along the Taurus molecular cloud. Impacting the atmosphere at about 66 kilometers per _second_ their [greenish](https://www.popastro.com/main_spa1/meteor/meteor-spectra-overview/) streaks point back to the [shower's radiant](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221028.html) just north of Orion's bright star Betelgeuse off the lower left side of the frame. [The familiar Pleiades](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230105.html) star cluster anchors the dusty celestial scene at the right.
