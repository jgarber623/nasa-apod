The dark [Horsehead Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231120.html) and the glowing [Orion Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191030.html) are contrasting cosmic vistas. Adrift 1,500 light-years away in one of [the night sky's](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220416.html) most recognizable [constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation)s, they appear in opposite corners of the above [stunning mosaic](https://www.galactic-hunter.com/post/ic-434-the-horsehead-flame-nebulae). The familiar [Horsehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsehead_Nebula) nebula appears as a dark cloud, a [small silhouette](https://i.redd.it/9lmbxkkm9bm41.jpg) notched against the long glow of hydrogen -- here shown in gold -- at the lower left. [Alnitak](https://www.gb.nrao.edu/~rmaddale/Education/OrionTourCenter/belt.html) is the easternmost star in [Orion's belt](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090210.html) and is seen as the brightest [star](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/) just below and to the left of the [Horsehead](https://www.liveabout.com/horse-head-drawing-step-by-step-tutorial-1123322). To the left of Alnitak is the [Flame Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221229.html), with clouds of bright emission and [dramatic](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090929.html) dark dust lanes. The magnificent emission region, the [Orion Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_nebula) (aka M42), lies at the upper right. Immediately to its left is a prominent [reflection nebula](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/reflection_nebulae.html) sometimes called the Running Man. Pervasive [tendrils](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090224.html) of glowing hydrogen gas are easily [traced](https://youtu.be/-PQpNb_yJVE) throughout the region.
