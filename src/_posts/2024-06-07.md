Blown by fast winds from a hot, massive star, this cosmic bubble is huge. Cataloged as [Sharpless](http://galaxymap.org/cat/list/sharpless/301) 2-308 it lies some 5,000 light-years away toward the well-trained constellation [Canis Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major) and covers slightly more of the sky than a Full Moon. That [corresponds](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/scale_distance.html) to a diameter of 60 light-years at its estimated distance. The massive star that created the bubble, a [Wolf-Rayet star](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf-Rayet_star), is the bright one [near the center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EZ_Canis_Majoris) of the nebula. [Wolf-Rayet stars](http://earthsky.org/space/wolf-rayets-are-the-most-massive-and-brightest-stars-known) have over 20 times the mass of the Sun and are thought to be in a brief, [pre-supernova phase](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030325.html) of massive star evolution. Fast winds from this [Wolf-Rayet star](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/hubble-view-wolf-rayet-stars-intense-and-short-lived) create the bubble-shaped nebula as they sweep up slower moving material from an earlier phase of evolution. The [windblown](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080522.html) nebula has an age of about 70,000 years. Relatively faint emission captured by narrowband filters [in the deep image](https://www.astrobin.com/u11wkp/0/) is dominated by the glow of ionized oxygen atoms [mapped to](https://hubblesite.org/contents/articles/the-meaning-of-light-and-color) a blue hue. Presenting a [mostly harmless](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/811-for-instance-on-the-planet-earth-man-had-always-assumed) outline, SH2-308 is also known as The Dolphin-head Nebula.
