Three bright objects satisfied seasoned stargazers of the western sky just after sunset earlier this month. The most familiar was [the Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/), seen on the upper left in a crescent [phase](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5187/). The rest of the Moon was [faintly visible](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211018.html) by sunlight first reflected by [the Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/). The bright planet [Jupiter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221025.html), the largest planet in [the Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/), is seen to the upper left. Most unusual was [Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12P/Pons%E2%80%93Brooks), below the Moon and showing a stubby dust tail on the right but an [impressive](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240408.html) ion [tail extending upwards](https://coleandmarmalade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cats-paradise-net.jpg). The featured image, a composite of several images taken consecutively at the same location and with the same camera, was taken near the village of [Llers](https://youtu.be/4bkOacxz86w), in [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain)'s [Girona province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Girona). Comet Pons-Brooks passed its closest to [the Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) last week and is now dimming as it [moves into southern skies](https://earthsky.org/tonight/12-p-comet-pons-brooks-outburst-millennium-falcon-bright-2024-eclipse/) and returns to the outer Solar System.
