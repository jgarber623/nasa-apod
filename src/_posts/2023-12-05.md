It was one of the most energetic particles ever known to strike the Earth -- but where did it come from? Dubbed [Amaterasu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaterasu_particle) after the [Shinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto) [sun goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaterasu), this particle, as do all [cosmic rays](https://www.auger.org/outreach/cosmic-rays/cosmic-ray-mystery) that strike the [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/earths-atmospheric-layers-3/), caused an [air shower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_shower_(physics)) of electrons, protons, and other [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle) to spray down onto the Earth below. In the [featured illustration](https://www.omu.ac.jp/en/info/research-news/entry-39535.html), a cosmic ray [air shower](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060814.html) is pictured striking the [Telescope Array](http://www.telescopearray.org/index.php/about/telescope-array) in [Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), which recorded the [Amaterasu event](https://attheu.utah.edu/facultystaff/cosmic-ray-2023/) in 2021 May. Cosmic ray air showers are common enough that you likely have been in a [particle spray](https://youtu.be/j-BBzWlOai0) yourself, although you likely wouldn't have noticed. The origin of this energetic particle, likely the [nucleus of an atom](https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsnuclei), remains a [mystery](https://www.intermountainpet.com/hubfs/Blog_Images/Dogs-tilting-their-heads.jpg) in two ways. First, it is [not known](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo5095) how any single particle or atomic nucleus can practically acquire [so much energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh-My-God_particle), and second, attempts to trace the particle back to where it originated did not indicate any likely potential source.
