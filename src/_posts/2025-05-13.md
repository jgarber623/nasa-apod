What does our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) look like from the top? Because we are on the [inside](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/104vf2/so_my_cat_likes_to_look_out_the_window/#lightbox), humanity can’t get an actual picture. Recently, however, just such a map has been made using location data for over a billion stars from ESA’s [Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_\(spacecraft\)) mission. The resulting [featured illustration](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2025/01/The_best_Milky_Way_map_by_Gaia_edge-on) shows that just like [many](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241226.html) [other](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240206.html) [spiral](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240101.html) [galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011004.html), our Milky Way has distinct spiral arms. [Our Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) and most of the bright stars we see at night are in just one arm: [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Arm). Gaia data bolsters previous indications that our Milky Way has more than two [spiral arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way#Spiral_arms). Our [Galaxy's center](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241124.html) sports a [prominent bar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050825.html). The colors of our Galaxy's [thin](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250512.html) disk derive mostly from dark [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100322.html), [bright blue stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241209.html), and [red emission nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241104.html). Although data analysis is ongoing, [Gaia was deactivated](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Operations/Farewell_Gaia!_Spacecraft_operations_come_to_an_end) in March after a succession mission.
