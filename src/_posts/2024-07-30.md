To some, it looks like a penguin. But to people who study the universe, it is an interesting example of two big galaxies interacting. Just a few hundred million years ago, the upper NGC 2936 was likely a [normal spiral galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130416.html): spinning, creating stars, and minding its own business. Then it got too close to the massive [elliptical galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy) NGC 2937, below, and took a dive. Together known as [Arp 142](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/124/01J06XYGEDEE86D1H9N5EJ9EG0), they are [featured](https://esawebb.org/news/weic2420/) in this new [Webb](https://webb.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html) [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) image, while a [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) [Hubble](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/) image appears in comparison. NGC 2936 is not only being deflected, but [distorted](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240320.html), by this close gravitational interaction. When massive galaxies [pass near](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130825.html) each other, gas is typically condensed from which [new stars form](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-highlights/exploring-the-birth-of-stars/). A [young group](https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/group-kittens-are-sitting-together-one-which-is-labeled-as-cat_900958-25003.jpg) of stars appears as the nose of the [penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin#/media/File:Penguin_in_Antarctica_jumping_out_of_the_water.jpg) toward the right of the upper galaxy, while in the center of the [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy), bright stars together appear as an eye. Before a billion years, the [two galaxies will likely merge](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220606.html) into one larger galaxy.
