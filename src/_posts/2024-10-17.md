[NASA's Europa Clipper](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/liftoff-nasas-europa-clipper-sails-toward-ocean-moon-of-jupiter/) is now headed toward an ocean world beyond Earth. The large spacecraft is tucked into the payload fairing atop the Falcon Heavy rocket in this [photo, taken at Kennedy Space Center](https://images.nasa.gov/details/KSC-20241013-PH-SPX03_0007) the day before the mission's successful October 14 launch. Europa Clipper's interplanetary voyage will first take it to Mars, then back to Earth, and then on to Jupiter on [gravity assist trajectories](https://science.nasa.gov/learn/basics-of-space-flight/primer/) that will allow it to enter orbit around Jupiter in April 2030. Once orbiting Jupiter, the spacecraft will fly past Europa 49 times, [exploring a Jovian moon](https://europa.nasa.gov/why-europa/overview/) with a global subsurface ocean that may have conditions to support life. Posing in the background next to the floodlit rocket is Comet Tsuchinsan-ATLAS, about a day after the comet's closest approach to Earth. A current darling of evening skies, the naked-eye comet is a [vistor from the distant Oort cloud](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153444/comet-tsuchinshan-atlas-arrives-from-afar)
