Did you see the full moon last month? During every month, on average, a [full moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html) occurs in the skies over [planet Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/). This is because [the Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/facts/) takes a [month](https://www.etymonline.com/word/month) to complete another orbit around our [home planet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100713.html), goes through all of its [phases](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-phases/), and once again has its entire Earth-facing half lit by reflected sunlight. Many [indigenous cultures give each full moon a name](https://www.easterntrail.org/why-native-americans-named-the-moons/), and this past full moon's [names include](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/full-moon-names.html) the Ice Moon, the Stay at Home Moon, and the Quiet Moon. Occurring in January on the [modern western calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar), several cultures have also named the most recent full moon the [Wolf Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120120.html), in honor of the [famous howling animal](https://youtu.be/Ee4EHJ_4mqI). Featured here above the Italian [Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps) mountains, this past [Wolf Moon](https://www.almanac.com/content/full-moon-january) was captured in combined long and short exposure images. The image is [striking](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/8b65d237-bffd-4135-8ae5-59dec7b8fe97/d4twduc-b1927b70-862a-4913-888f-c68904288435.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzhiNjVkMjM3LWJmZmQtNDEzNS04YWU1LTU5ZGVjN2I4ZmU5N1wvZDR0d2R1Yy1iMTkyN2I3MC04NjJhLTQ5MTMtODg4Zi1jNjg5MDQyODg0MzUuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.It45UJ0Q-VdWQDi7FMCydWHU6DUexrwmm_c1CiNwGm0) because, to some, the surrounding clouds appear as a wolf's mouth ready to swallow the [Wolf Moon](https://earthsky.org/tonight/january-full-moon-is-the-wolf-moon/), while others see the Moon as a wolf's eye.
