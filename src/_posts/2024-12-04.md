Does the Sun return to the same spot on the sky every day?  No.  A more visual answer is an [analemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma), a composite of sky images taken at the same time and from the same place over a year.  At completion, you can see that the Sun makes a [f](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230923.html)[i](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220918.html)[g](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220702.html)[u](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220621.html)[r](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200507.html)[e](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161221.html) [8](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160822.html) on the sky. The [featured unusual analemma](https://youtu.be/7QB_MOemCqs) does not, however, picture the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/facts/) directly: it was created by looking in the [opposite direction](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190624.html). All that was required was noting where the [shadow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240605.html) of an edge of a [house](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220426.html) was in the [driveway](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231015.html) every clear day at the same time. Starting in March in [Falcon](https://youtu.be/mcvWYKz8kj4), [Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado), [USA](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/), the photographer methodically marked the shadow's 1 pm location. In one frame you can even see the [photographer](https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/funny-white-furry-cat-photographer-looks-focused_295789-60.jpg) himself. Although this analemma will be completed in 2025, you can start drawing [your own driveway analemma](http://www.austintek.com/astro/analemma/analemma.html) -- using no fancy equipment -- as soon as today.
