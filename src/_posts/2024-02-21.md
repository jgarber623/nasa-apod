The bird is bigger than the peak. Nicknamed for its [avian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/avian#Adjective) shape, the [Seagull Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230119.html) is an [emission nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/emission_nebulae.html) on the night sky that is [vast](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240123.html), spanning an angle over five times the diameter of the [full moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html) and over 200 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/). The head of the nebula is catalogued as [IC 2177](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_2177), and the star cluster under its right wing is catalogued as NGC 2343. Consisting of mostly red-glowing [hydrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml) gas, the [Seagull Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180316.html) incorporates some dust lanes and is forming [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/). The peak over which this Seagull [seems to soar](https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000031354923-a6ixw8-t500x500.jpg) occurs at [Pinnacles National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinnacles_National_Park) in [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).
