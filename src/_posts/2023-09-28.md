Ridges of glowing interstellar gas and dark dust clouds inhabit the [turbulent, cosmic depths](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/videos/2018/21/1030-Video.html) of the Lagoon Nebula. Also known as M8, The bright star forming region is about 5,000 light-years distant. It makes for a popular stop on [telescopic tours](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210426.html) of the constellation Sagittarius toward the center of our Milky Way Galaxy. Dominated by the telltale red emission of ionized hydrogen atoms recombining with stripped electrons, this [deep telescopic view](https://astrodrudis.com/messier-8-another-view/) of the Lagoon's central reaches is about 40 light-years across. The bright hourglass shape [near the center](https://esahubble.org/images/heic1808a/) of the frame is gas ionized and sculpted by energetic radiation and extreme stellar winds from a [massive young star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140820.html).
