Nine days ago, two quite different sky icons were imaged rising together. Specifically, Earth's Moon shared the eastern sky with the [sister stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades_\(Greek_mythology\)) of the Pleiades cluster, as viewed from [Alberta](https://youtu.be/COtpTM1MpAA), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada). Astronomical images of the [well-known Pleiades](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221205.html) often show the star cluster's alluring blue [reflection nebula](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/reflection-nebula/)s, but here they are washed-out by the orange [moonrise](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211010.html) sky. The half-lit Moon, known as a [quarter moon](https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/moon-phases-fromsse.jpg), is overexposed, although the outline of the dim lunar night side can be seen by illuminating [earthshine](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211018.html), light first reflected from the Earth. The [featured image](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1185547962683479) is a composite of [eight successive](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/cute-cat-kittens-sitting-each-other-order-dark-to-light-color-all-looking-towards-camera-isolated-white-297725989.jpg) exposures with brightnesses adjusted to match what the [human eye](https://www.geogebra.org/m/SjGyuKNs) would see. The Moon passes [nearly](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180319.html) -- or [directly](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100326.html) -- in front of [the Pleaides](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240129.html) once a month.
