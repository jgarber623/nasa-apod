This is a good week to see meteors. Comet dust will rain down on planet Earth, streaking through dark skies during peak nights of the annual [Perseid Meteor Shower](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180808.html). The featured composite image was taken during the 2018 Perseids from the [Poloniny Dark Sky Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poloniny_Dark-Sky_Park) in [Slovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia). The dome of the observatory in the foreground is on the grounds of [Kolonica Observatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HpMVwLGwOI). Although the [comet dust particles](https://www.universetoday.com/88094/the-perseids-why-is-there-a-meteor-shower/) travel parallel to each other, the [resulting shower meteors](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/perseids/in-depth/) clearly seem to [radiate from a single point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_(meteor_shower)) on the sky in the [eponym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eponym)ous constellation [Perseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_(constellation)). The radiant effect is due to [perspective](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/64/fa/a3/64faa39143ee4aeff8cce3b7e452f4df--forced-perspective.jpg), as the parallel tracks appear to converge at a distance, like [train tracks](http://en.es-static.us/upl/2010/12/railroad-tracks-converge-shutterstock-e1367591337388.jpg). The [Perseid Meteor Shower](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/details.php?id=1584) is expected to reach its [highest peak](https://www.omlet.us/images/originals/cat_on_high_perch.jpg) on Saturday after midnight. Since a [crescent Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230527.html) will rise only very late [that night](https://www.amsmeteors.org/2023/08/viewing-the-perseid-meteor-shower-in-2023/), cloudless skies will be darker than usual, making a high number of faint meteors [potentially visible](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/) this year.
