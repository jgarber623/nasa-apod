The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft's arm reached out and touched asteroid 101955 Bennu [on October 20](https://youtu.be/xj0O-fLSV7c), 2020, after a [careful approach](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201012.html) to the small, near-Earth asteroid's boulder-strewn surface. Dubbed a [Touch-And-Go (TAG) sampling event](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/osiris-rex-tags-surface-of-asteroid-bennu/), the 30 centimeter wide sampling head (TAGSAM) appears to crush some of the rocks in this close-up recorded by the spacecraft's SamCam. The image was snapped just after surface contact some 321 million kilometers from planet Earth. One second later, the spacecraft fired nitrogen gas from a bottle intended to blow a substantial amount of [Bennu's regolith](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200916.html) into the sampling head, collecting the [loose surface material](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2010/E_tag_aftermath.gif). And now, nearly three years later, on Sunday, September 24, that sample of asteroid Bennu is scheduled to [arrive on planet Earth](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-completes-last-osiris-rex-test-before-asteroid-sample-delivery). The sample return capsule will be [dropped off by the OSIRIS-Rex](https://blogs.nasa.gov/osiris-rex/2023/09/08/heres-how-sept-24-asteroid-sample-delivery-will-work/) spacecraft as it makes a close flyby of Earth. Twenty minutes after the drop-off, the spacecraft will fire its thrusters to divert past Earth and continue on to orbit near-Earth [asteroid 99942 Apophis](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/apophis/in-depth/).
