[The giant galaxy](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad9f5c) cataloged as LEDA 1313424 is about two and a half times the size of our own Milky Way. Its remarkable appearance in this [recently released Hubble](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2025/news-2025-006) Space Telescope image strongly suggests its nickname "The Bullseye Galaxy". Known as a collisional ring galaxy it has [nine rings](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2025/006/01JH3M8FV7QTE0NTS9YEP6722W) confirmed by telescopic observations, [rippling](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220824.html) from its center like waves from a pebble dropped into a pond. Of course, the pebble dropped into the Bullseye galaxy was a galaxy itself. Telescopic observations identify the blue dwarf galaxy at center-left as the likely collider, passing through the giant galaxy's center and forming concentric rings in the wake of their gravitational interaction. The Bullseye Galaxy lies some 567 million light-years away toward the constellation Pisces. [At that distance](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2025/006/01JJADPV8HK2BGG1T12HDSVKT5), this stunning Hubble image would span about 530,000 light-years.
