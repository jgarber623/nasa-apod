[Birds](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds) don't fly this high. [Airplanes](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/UEET/StudentSite/airplanes.html) don't go this fast. The [Statue of Liberty](https://www.nps.gov/stli/) weighs less. No [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species) other than [human](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190818.html) can even comprehend [what is going on](https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gary-confused-kitten-eyebrows-andy-caroline-entwistle-manchester-7.jpg), nor could any [human](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/photos.html) just a [millennium ago](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010101.html). The launch of a [rocket](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/TRC/Rockets/history_of_rockets.html) bound for space is an event that [inspires awe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161017.html) and challenges description. Pictured here last week, the [Indian Space Research Organization](https://www.isro.gov.in/)'s [LVM3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LVM3) rocket [blasted off](https://youtu.be/q2ueCg9bvvQ?t=2104) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on [Sriharikota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sriharikota) Island, [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India). From a standing start, the 600,000+ kilogram [rocket ship](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180624.html) lifted the massive [Chandrayaan-3](https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan3_New.html) off the Earth. The [Chandrayaan-3 mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayaan-3) is scheduled to reach the Moon in late August and land a [robotic rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayaan-3#/media/File:Chandrayaan-3_Rover.webp) near the [lunar South Pole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220410.html). [Rockets](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/launching-into-space/) bound for space are now [launched](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210401.html) from somewhere on Earth [every few days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_in_spaceflight).
