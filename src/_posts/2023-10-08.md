What's that in front of the Sun? The closest object is an [airplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_flying_machines), visible just below the Sun's center and caught purely by chance. Next out are numerous clouds in [Earth's atmosphere](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2919/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/), creating a series of darkened horizontal streaks. Farther out is [Earth's Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/), seen as the large dark circular bite on the upper right. Just above the airplane and just below the Sun's surface are sunspots. The main sunspot group captured here, [AR 2192](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141025.html), was in 2014 one of the largest ever recorded and had been [crackling](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141022.html) and bursting with flares since it came around the edge of the Sun a week before. This show of solar silhouettes was unfortunately short-lived. Within a few seconds the plane flew away. Within a few minutes the clouds drifted off. Within a few hours the [partial solar eclipse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_October_23,_2014) of the Sun by the Moon was over. Fortunately, when it comes to the Sun, even [unexpecte](https://live.staticflickr.com/1893/42812115870_c01b15d20b_b.jpg)d a[lignments](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110115.html) are [surprisingly frequent](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130513.html). Perhaps one will be imaged this Saturday when a [new partial solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2023/where-when/) will be visible from much of [North and South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas#/media/File:Americas_(orthographic_projection).svg).
