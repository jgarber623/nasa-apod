What color is Pluto, really? It took some effort to figure out. Even given all of the [images sent back](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150831.html) to Earth when the robotic [New Horizons](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/new-horizons/) spacecraft [sped past Pluto](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170731.html) in 2015, processing these [multi-spectral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_(New_Horizons)) frames to approximate what the [human eye](https://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/humanvision/accommodation/index.html) would see was challenging. The result [featured here](http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Galleries/Featured-Images/image.php?page=1&gallery_id=2&image_id=543), released three years after the raw data was acquired by [New Horizons](http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Spacecraft.php#Systems-and-Components), is the highest resolution true color image of [Pluto](https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/) ever taken. Visible in the image is the light-colored, heart-shaped, [Tombaugh Regio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombaugh_Regio), with the unexpectedly smooth [Sputnik Planitia](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161122.html), made of frozen [nitrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/7.shtml), filling its western lobe. New Horizons found the dwarf planet to have a [surprisingly complex surface](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150914.html) composed of many regions having [perceptibly different hues](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fxvdk3cwfp1171.jpg). In total, though, Pluto is [mostly brown](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060903.html), with much of its muted color originating from small amounts of surface [methane](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/first-you-see-it-then-you-dont-scientists-closer-to-explaining-mars-methane-mystery/) energized by [ultraviolet light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) from the Sun.
