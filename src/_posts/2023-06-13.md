Jupiter's moons [circle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221025.html) Jupiter. The [featured video](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmgill/44583965185/in/photostream/) depicts Europa and Io, two of [Jupiter's largest moons](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap001118.html), crossing in front of the grand planet's [Great Red Spot](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220109.html), the largest known storm system in our [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System). The video was composed from images taken by the [robotic Cassini spacecraft](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/mission/spacecraft/cassini-orbiter/) as it passed Jupiter in 2000, on its way to Saturn. The two moons visible are [volcanic Io](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221211.html), in the distance, and [icy Europa](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/europa/en/). In the time-lapse video, Europa appears to overtake Io, which is [odd](https://www.intermountainpet.com/hubfs/Blog_Images/Dogs-tilting-their-heads.jpg) because Io is closer to [Jupiter](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/) and moves faster. The explanation is that the motion of the fast [Cassini](https://www.planetary.org/space-missions/cassini) spacecraft changes the camera location significantly during imaging. Jupiter is currently being visited by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s robotic [Juno spacecraft](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/spacecraft/), while [ESA](https://www.esa.int/)'s [Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Juice) (JUICE), [launched](https://youtu.be/MvHcGmQPcsI?t=1788) in April, is enroute.
