This dance is to the death. As these two large galaxies duel, a [cosmic bridge](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140715.html) of stars, gas, and dust currently stretches over 75,000 [light-years](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html) and joins them. The bridge itself is strong evidence that these two immense star systems have [passed close](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130514.html) to each other and experienced [violent tides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcDtJ_-jdMw) induced by mutual gravity. As further evidence, the face-on spiral galaxy on the right, also known as NGC 3808A, exhibits many young blue star clusters produced in a burst of star formation. The twisted edge-on spiral on the left (NGC 3808B) seems to be wrapped in the material [bridging the galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061111.html) and surrounded by a curious [polar ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141108.html). Together, the system is known as [Arp 87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arp_87). While such interactions are drawn out over billions of years, repeated [close passages](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120717.html) will ultimately create one merged galaxy. Although [this scenario](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...178..623T/abstract) does look unusual, galactic mergers are thought to be common, with Arp 87 representing a stage in [this inevitable process](http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~jhibbard/MergeSeq/mergeseq.html). The [Arp 87 dancing pair](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2007/news-2007-36.html) are about 300 million [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) distant toward the constellation of the Lion ([Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(constellation))). The [prominent edge-on spiral](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190329.html) galaxy at the far left appears to be a more distant background galaxy and not involved in the on-going merger.
