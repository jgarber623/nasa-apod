Stickney Crater, the largest crater on the martian moon Phobos, is named for [Chloe Angeline Stickney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angeline_Stickney) Hall, [mathematician and](https://archive.org/details/anastronomerswi03hallgoog) wife of astronomer Asaph Hall. Asaph Hall discovered both the [Red Planet's moons](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201030.html) in 1877. Over 9 kilometers across, Stickney is nearly half the diameter of Phobos itself, so large that the impact that blasted out the crater likely came close to shattering the tiny moon. This [enhanced-color image](http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/phobos.php) of Stickney and surroundings was recorded by the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as it passed within some six thousand kilometers [of Phobos](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170721.html) in March of 2008. Even though the surface gravity of [asteroid-like Phobos](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/mars-moons/phobos/in-depth/) is less than 1/1000th Earth's gravity, streaks suggest loose material slid down inside the crater walls over time. Light bluish regions near the crater's rim could indicate a relatively freshly exposed surface. The origin of the curious grooves along the surface is mysterious but may be related to tidal stresses experienced by [close-orbiting](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220703.html) Phobos or [the crater-forming impact](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016GeoRL..4310595B) itself.
