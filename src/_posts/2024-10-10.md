Each comet was memorable for earthbound skygazers, starting at top left with [Comet McNaught](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070122.html), the 21st century's brightest comet (so far).

By the end of October 2024, the blank 6th panel may be filled with bright sungrazer comet [C/2024 S1 Atlas](https://earthsky.org/space/sungrazer-comet-bright-daytime-a11bp7i/). ...
