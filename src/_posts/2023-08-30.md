[Near perigee](https://moon.nasa.gov/diy-moon-orbit/), the closest point in its almost moonthly orbit, a Full Moon rose as the Sun set on August 1. Its brighter than average lunar disk was captured in this dramatic moonrise sequence over dense cloud banks along the eastern horizon from Ragusa, Sicily. Illuminating night skies around planet Earth it was the second [supermoon of 2023](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/what-is-a-supermoon/). Yet again near perigee, the third supermoon of 2023 will also [shine on an August night](https://moon.nasa.gov/news/196/the-next-full-moon-is-a-supermoon-the-sturgeon-moon/). Rising as the Sun sets tonight this second Full Moon in August will be known to some as a Blue Moon, even though scattered sunlight gives the lunar disk a reddened hue. Defined as the second full moon in a calendar month, [blue moons](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/when-is-the-next-blue-moon/) occur only once every 2 or 3 years. That's because lunar phases take 29.5 days, almost a calendar month, to go through a complete cycle. [Tonight an August Blue Moon](https://earthsky.org/tonight/full-blue-moon-near-saturn-supermoon-august-30-31-2023/) will find itself beside bright planet Saturn.
