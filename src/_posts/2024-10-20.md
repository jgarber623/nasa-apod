Is our universe haunted? It might look that way on this [dark matter](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/dark-matter/) map. The gravity of unseen [dark matter](https://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/dark_matter/) is the leading explanation for why [galaxies rotate so fast](http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci/lectures/darkmatter.htm), why [galaxies orbit clusters so fast](https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/galaxy-clusters-prove-dark-matters-existence-fd962c979458), why [gravitational lenses so strongly deflect light](https://www.lsst.org/sites/default/files/img/xxnyt.jpg), and why [visible matter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140512.html) is distributed as it is both [in the local universe](https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~mwhite/models.html) and [on the cosmic](http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/driving2.html) [microwave background](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130325.html). The featured image from the [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.amnh.org/)'s [Hayden Planetarium](https://www.amnh.org/research/hayden-planetarium) Space Show Dark Universe highlights one example of how pervasive dark matter might haunt our universe. In this frame from a [detailed computer simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEEg1XkbXDo), complex filaments of dark matter, shown in black, are strewn [about the universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111003.html) like [spider webs](https://www.badspiderbites.com/giant-spider-web/), while the relatively rare clumps of familiar [baryon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon)ic matter are colored orange. [These simulations](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/~kaehler/homepage/visualizations/dark-matter.html) are good statistical matches to astronomical observations. In what is perhaps a scarier turn of events, [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) -- although quite strange and in an [unknown form](https://home.cern/science/physics/dark-matter) -- is no longer thought to be the strangest source of [gravity in the universe](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AmJPh..76..265N/abstract). That honor now falls to [dark energy](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/dark-matter-dark-energy/), a more uniform source of [repulsive gravity](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/11/16/why-does-dark-energy-make-the-universe-accelerate/) that seems to now dominate the expansion of the entire universe.
