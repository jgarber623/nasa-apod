[A tiny moon with a scary name](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/hubble-sees-martian-moon-orbiting-the-red-planet), Phobos emerges from behind the Red Planet in this timelapse sequence from the Earth-orbiting [Hubble Space Telescope](http://hubblesite.org/). Over 22 minutes the 13 separate exposures were captured near the 2016 closest [approach of Mars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160809.html) to planet Earth. [Martians](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150516.html) have to look to the west to watch Phobos rise, though. The small moon is closer to its [parent planet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031024.html) than any other moon in the Solar System, about 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers) [above the Martian surface](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031129.html). It completes one orbit in just 7 hours and 39 minutes. That's faster than a Mars rotation, which corresponds to about 24 hours and 40 minutes. So on Mars, Phobos can be seen to rise above the western horizon 3 times a day. Still, [Phobos is doomed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121028.html).
