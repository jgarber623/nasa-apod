Saturn now rises before midnight in planet Earth's sky. On July 24, the naked-eye planet was in close conjunction, [close on the sky](https://www.space.com/moon-saturn-night-sky-july-23-2024), to a waning gibbous Moon. But from some locations on planet Earth the [ringed gas giant](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/) was occulted, [disappearing behind](https://in-the-sky.org/news.php?id=20240724_16_100) the Moon for about an hour from skies over parts of Asia and Africa. Because the Moon and bright planets wander through the sky near the [ecliptic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic), such [occultation events](http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/planets/planets.htm) are not uncommon, but they can be [dramatic](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030724.html). In this telescopic view from Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, Saturn is caught moments before its disappearance behind the lunar disk. The snapshot gives the illusion that Saturn hangs just above [Glushko crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glushko_\(crater\)), a [43 kilometer diameter](https://sci.esa.int/web/smart-1/-/37704-crater-glushko), young, ray crater near the Moon's western edge. Of course, the Moon is 400 thousand kilometers away, compared to Saturn's distance of 1.4 [billion](http://kokogiak.com/megapenny/nine.asp) kilometers.
