[The beautiful Trifid Nebula](https://www.flickr.com/photos/182271718@N06/53805589566/) is a cosmic [study](https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/july-04/) in contrasts. [Also known as M20](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-20/), it lies about 5,000 light-years away toward the [nebula rich](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130712.html) constellation Sagittarius. A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy, the Trifid does illustrate three different types of astronomical nebulae; red [emission nebulae](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080424.html) dominated by light from hydrogen atoms, blue [reflection nebulae](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090521.html) produced by dust reflecting starlight, and [dark nebulae](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090522.html) where dense dust clouds appear in silhouette. But the red emission region, roughly separated into three parts by obscuring dust lanes, is what lends the Trifid its [popular name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifid_Nebula). Pillars and jets sculpted by newborn stars, above and right of the emission nebula's center, appear in famous Hubble Space Telescope [close-up images](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/1999/42/915-Image.html) of the region. The Trifid Nebula is about 40 light-years across. Too faint to be seen by the unaided eye, it almost covers the area of a full moon on planet Earth's sky.
