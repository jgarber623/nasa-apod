Gliding through the outer [Solar System](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/), in 1989 the [Voyager 2 spacecraft](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/voyager-2) looked toward the Sun to find this view of most distant planet Neptune and its moon [Triton](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070304.html) together in a crescent phase. The elegant image of [ice-giant planet](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/neptune/in-depth/) and [largest moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(moon)) was taken from behind just after Voyager's [closest approach](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140826.html). It could not have been taken from Earth because the most distant planet never shows a crescent phase [to sunward eyes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220923.html). Heading for the [heliopause and beyond](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/voyager-2-illuminates-boundary-of-interstellar-space), the spacecraft's [parting vantage](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02247) point also robs Neptune of its familiar [blue hue](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150215.html).
