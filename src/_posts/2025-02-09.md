What strange world is this? [E](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150223.html)[a](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121017.html)[r](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150126.html)[t](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150412.html)[h](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130505.html). In the foreground of the featured image are the [Pinnacles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pinnacles_\(Western_Australia\)), unusual rock spires in [Nambung National Park](https://youtu.be/7XOkWFIjz_M) in Western [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia). Made of ancient sea shells ([limestone](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2011-05-11-ct-x-c-fossils-in-chicagoland-buildin20110511-story.html)), how these human-sized [picturesque spires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do7zg4wJfyE) formed remains unknown. In the background, just past the end of the central Pinnacle, is a bright crescent Moon. The eerie glow around the Moon is mostly [zodiacal light](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140911.html), sunlight reflected by dust grains orbiting between the planets in the [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/solar-system-facts/). Arching across the top is the central band of our [Milky Way Galaxy](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/galaxy.html). Many famous [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/) and [nebulas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120106.html) are also visible in the background night sky. The featured 29-panel panorama was taken and composed in 2015 September after detailed planning that involved the Moon, the rock spires, and their corresponding [shadow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190217.html)s. Even so, the strong zodiacal light was a pleasant [surprise](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/8yooo5/happy_kitten/#lightbox).
