What is creating these unusual spots? Light-colored spots on [Martian rocks](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap991030.html), each surrounded by a dark border, were discovered earlier this month by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s [Perseverance Rover](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/) currently exploring [Mars](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/). Dubbed [leopard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard#/media/File:African_leopard_male_\(cropped\).jpg) spots because of their seemingly similarity to markings on famous [Earth-bound predators](https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/front-view-kitten-hunting-pose_7502-2520.jpg), these curious patterns are being studied with the possibility they were created by [ancient Martian life](https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/was-there-life-on-mars/). The [pictured](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/perseverance-finds-a-rock-with-leopard-spots/) spots measure only [millimeter](https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-the-size-of-a-millimeter)s across and were discovered on a [larger rock](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lunexit/53885766401/in/pool-apods/) named [Cheyava Falls](https://youtu.be/bknMDwCjFHo%22). The exciting but [unproven speculation](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasas-perseverance-rover-discovers-a-rock-that-may-contain-alien/) is that long ago, [microbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism)s generated energy with chemical reactions that turned rock from red to white while leaving a dark ring, like some [similarly appearing spots](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/earliest-life-on-earth-rocks) on [Earth rocks](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC3T4BT). Although other [non-biological explanations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematite#Mars) may ultimately prevail, speculation focusing on this potential biological origin is causing [much intrigue](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/science/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-rock.html).
