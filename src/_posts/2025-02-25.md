Why are there so many bright blue stars? Stars are usually born in [clusters](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/star-clusters-inside-the-universes-stellar-collections/), and the brightest and most massive of these stars typically glow blue. Less-bright, non-blue stars like our [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) surely also exist in this [M41](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_41) star cluster but are harder to see. A few bright orange-appearing [red giant stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant) are visible. The red-light filaments are emitted by diffuse hydrogen gas, a [color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-alpha) that was specifically filtered and enhanced in this image. In a hundred million years or so, the bright blue stars will have exploded in [supernova](https://youtu.be/wymMn-SmALY)s and disappeared, while the slightly different trajectories of the fainter stars will cause [this picturesque](https://app.astrobin.com/u/Flying_Dutchman?i=wdu704#gallery) open cluster to disperse. Similarly, billions of years ago, our own Sun was likely born into a [star cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cluster) like M41, but it has long since [drifted apart](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2BC0K5D/two-cats-sitting-in-safe-social-distance-separated-by-an-open-drainage-channel-in-the-street-with-natural-stone-paving-in-a-greek-village-cyclades-2BC0K5D.jpg) from its [sister stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241209.html). The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/astrobin_com/p/DFVAtOqNm2Y/) was captured over four hours with [Chilescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHILESCOPE) T2 in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile).
