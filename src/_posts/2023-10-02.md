Sometimes lightning occurs out near space. One such [lightning](https://scijinks.gov/lightning/) type is [red sprite lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(lightning)), which has only been photographed and studied on [Earth](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-earth/) over the past 25 years. The origins of all types of [lightning](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/lightning/) remain topics for research, and scientists are still trying to figure out why [red sprite lightning](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230918.html) occurs at all. Research [has shown](https://earthweb.ess.washington.edu/space/AtmosElec/spriteinfo.html) that following a powerful positive [cloud-to-ground lightning](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120723.html) strike, [red sprites](https://earthsky.org/earth/definition-what-are-lightning-sprites/) may start as 100-meter balls of [ionized air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionized-air_glow) that shoot down from about 80-km high at 10 percent the [speed of light](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/three-ways-to-travel-at-nearly-the-speed-of-light). They are [quickly followed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210104.html) by a group of upward streaking [ionized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization) balls. [Featured here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/376355972487572/permalink/6327770937346016/) is an [extraordinarily high-resolution](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/96/d5/19/96d5193fa5f6968243838aef44d4b4b7.jpg) image of a [group of red sprites](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170615.html). This image is a single frame lasting only 1/25th of a second from a video taken above [Castelnaud Castle](https://youtu.be/2lUm6m4T8Ds?t=17) in [Dordogne](https://youtu.be/l5Ybmr-M4JQ), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), about three weeks ago. The sprites quickly vanished -- no sprites were visible even on the very next video frame.
