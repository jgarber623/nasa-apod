Made with narrowband filters, this [cosmic snapshot](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10223414230199977&set=a.3219810570180) covers a field of view about the size of the full Moon within the boundaries of the constellation Cygnus. It highlights the bright edge of a ring-like nebula traced by the [glow of ionized](https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/585450-ok-ill-ask-it-what-are-definitions-of-sho-and-hoo/) sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen gas. Embedded in [the region's interstellar clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220609.html) of gas and dust, the complex, glowing arcs are sections of bubbles or shells of material [swept up by the wind](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090915.html) from [Wolf-Rayet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230318.html) star WR 134, brightest star near the center of the frame. Distance estimates put WR 134 about 6,000 light-years away, making the frame over 50 light-years across. [Shedding](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995A&A...304..491E) their outer envelopes in powerful stellar winds, massive Wolf-Rayet stars have burned through their nuclear fuel at a [prodigious rate](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2003/ngc6888/) and end this final phase of massive star evolution in a spectacular supernova explosion. The stellar winds and final supernovae enrich the interstellar material with [heavy elements](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011026.html) to be incorporated in [future generations of stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120517.html).
