What does Orion rising look like to a camera? During this time of the year, the [famous constellation](https://universe.nasa.gov/news/147/discovering-the-universe-through-the-constellation-orion/) is visible to the southeast just after sunset. From most [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/)ly locations, [Orion's familiar star pattern](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030207.html), highlighted by the [three-stars-in-a-row belt stars, rises](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171123.html) [sideways](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201225.html). An entire section of the night sky that includes Orion was photographed rising above [Śnieżka](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Anie%C5%BCka), a [mountain](https://youtu.be/i9W_ek8b61I) on the border between [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland) and the [Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic). The long duration exposure sequence brings up many faint features including the [Orion](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210629.html) and [Flame](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211103.html) Nebulas, both encompassed by the curving [Barnard's Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard%27s_Loop). The [featured](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2FpvawMzw9/) wide-angle [camera composite](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180321.html) also captured night sky icons including the blue [Pleiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades) star cluster at the image top and the red [Rosette Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210214.html) to the left of Orion. [Famous stars](https://w0.peakpx.com/wallpaper/264/469/HD-wallpaper-cat-stars-glasses-sky-animal-sea-summer-funny-face-pink-pisica.jpg) in the frame include [Sirius](https://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/sirius-the-brightest-star/), [Betelgeuse](https://universe.nasa.gov/news/237/what-is-betelgeuse-inside-the-strange-volatile-star/), [Rigel](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220124.html) and [Aldebaran](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/meet-aldebaran-the-bulls-eye/). Orion will appear successively higher in the sky at [sunset](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231025.html) during the coming months.
