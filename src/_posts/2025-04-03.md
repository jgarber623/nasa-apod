[A 26 hour old Moon](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5415/) poses behind the craggy outline of the Italian Dolomites in this twilight mountain and skyscape. The one second long exposure was captured near moonset on March 30. And while only a [a sliver](https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/SearchPhotos/photo.pl?mission=ISS028&roll=E&frame=20073) of its sunlit surface is visible, most of the Moon's disk can be seen by [earthshine as light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthlight_\(astronomy\)) reflected from a bright planet Earth illuminates the lunar nearside. Also known as the Moon's ashen glow, a description of earthshine in terms of sunlight reflected by Earth's oceans illuminating the Moon's dark surface was written over 500 years ago by [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.mos.org/leonardo/). Of course earthshine is just the most familiar example of [planetshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetshine), the faint illumination of the dark portion of a moon by light reflected [from its planet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210730.html).
