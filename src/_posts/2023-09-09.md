Comet Nishimura is growing. More precisely, the tails [C/2023 P1 (Nishimura)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_P1_(Nishimura)) are growing as it nears the Sun. Discovered only last month, the [comet](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/en/) is already near naked eye brightness as it now moves inside the Earth's orbit. The comet will be nearest the [Earth](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/) next week, but nearest the Sun the week after -- on September 17. Speculation holds that expelled ice and dust from [Comet Nishimura](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230821.html)'s last visit to the inner [Solar System](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/) may have created the [Sigma Hydrids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Hydrids) meteor shower which peaks yearly in December. If so, then this [meteor shower](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180808.html) may become more active, [refreshed](https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy80MTY0MTI3L29yaWdpbi5qcGciLCJleHBpcmVzX2F0IjoxNzA1Mzg5MjY1fQ.6M9vsWms-VGr9rPN1WvxANS2gjpEtNTYtBqtc4CDEZ8/img.jpg) with new [comet debris](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171106.html). [Pictured, Comet Nishimura](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.287149497346968&type=3) was captured from [Edgewood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgewood,_New_Mexico), [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) four nights ago, showing a long ion tail structured by interactions with the [Sun's wind](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/2288/the-solar-wind-across-our-solar-system/). Look for [this comet](https://earthsky.org/tonight/new-comet-c-2023-p1-nishimura-bright-august-september-october-2023/) near your eastern horizon just before sunrise for the next few mornings, but very near your western horizon just after sunset next week -- as its coma [continues to brighten](http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2023P1/2023P1.html) and its [tails continue](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131117.html) to grow.
