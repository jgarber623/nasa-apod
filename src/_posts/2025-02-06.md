[Grand spiral galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210813.html) often seem to get all the glory, flaunting their young, bright, blue star clusters in beautiful, symmetric [spiral](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080517.html) arms. But small, irregular galaxies form stars too. In fact [dwarf galaxy IC 2574 shows](https://fenyeslorand.hu/coddington_ic2574/) clear [evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0193) of intense star forming activity in its telltale reddish regions of glowing hydrogen gas. Just as in spiral galaxies, the [turbulent](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240627.html) star-forming regions in IC 2574 are churned by [stellar winds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250203.html) and supernova explosions spewing material into the galaxy's interstellar medium and [triggering](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111120.html) further star formation. A mere 12 million light-years distant, IC 2574 is part of the M81 group of galaxies, seen toward the northern constellation Ursa Major. Also known as Coddington's Nebula, the lovely [island universe](https://history.aip.org/exhibits/cosmology/ideas/island.htm) is about 50,000 light-years across, discovered by American astronomer Edwin Coddington in 1898.
