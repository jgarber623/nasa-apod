Very faint planetary nebula Abell 7 is about 1,800 light-years distant. It lies just south of Orion in planet Earth's skies toward the constellation [Lepus, The Hare](http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/big/lepus28vm-b.jpg). Surrounded by Milky Way stars and near the line-of-sight to distant background galaxies its [generally](http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6226) simple spherical shape, about 8 light-years in diameter, is revealed in this deep telescopic image. Within the cosmic cloud are beautiful and complex structures though, enhanced by the use of long exposures and [narrowband](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111013.html) filters that capture emission from hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen atoms. Otherwise Abell 7 would be much too faint to be appreciated [by eye](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100506.html). A [planetary nebula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula) represents a very brief final phase in stellar evolution that our own Sun will experience 5 billion [years hence](http://www.futuretimeline.net/beyond.htm), as the nebula's central, once sun-like star shrugs off its outer layers. Abell 7 itself is estimated to be 20,000 years old. But its central star, seen here as a [fading white dwarf](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/citizen-scientist-finds-ancient-white-dwarf-star-encircled-by-puzzling-rings), is some 10 billion years old.
