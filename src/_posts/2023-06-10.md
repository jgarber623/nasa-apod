[This month, bright Mars and brilliant Venus](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/) are the prominent celestial beacons in planet Earth's western skies after sunset. Wandering through the constellation Cancer the Crab, the Red Planet was [captured here](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=6895848777110177&set=ecnf.100000553682989) on the evening of June 3 near the stars of [open cluster Messier 44](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220430.html). Recognized since antiquity this nearby, naked-eye star cluster is also known as the Praesepe or the Beehive cluster. A swarm of stars all much younger than the Sun, the Beehive cluster is a mere 600 light-years distant. Seen with a yellowish hue, Mars is about 17 light-minutes away. [On June 12/13 Venus](https://earthsky.org/tonight/venus-and-the-beehive-see-them-together-june-12-and-13-2023/) will take its turn posing next to the stars of the Beehive cluster. But the dazzling light of Venus will make the Beehive stars difficult to see by eye alone.
