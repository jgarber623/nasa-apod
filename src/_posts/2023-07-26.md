South of [Antares](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060714.html), in the tail of the nebula-rich constellation [Scorpius](https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1340d/), lies [emission nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_nebula) IC 4628. Nearby hot, [massive stars](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve), millions of years young, [irradiate the nebula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_II_region) with invisible [ultraviolet](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) light, stripping electrons from atoms. The electrons eventually recombine with the atoms to produce the [visible](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight) nebular glow, dominated by the red emission of hydrogen. At an estimated distance of 6,000 light-years, the [region shown](https://www.eso.org/public/videos/eso1535a/) is about 250 [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/)s across, spanning over three full moons [on the sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130801.html). The nebula is also [cataloged as](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060519.html) Gum 56 for Australian astronomer [Colin Stanley Gum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Gum), but seafood-loving deep sky-enthusiasts might know this cosmic cloud as the [Prawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prawn) [Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prawn_Nebula). The [graceful color image](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cui2J5BOftH/) is a new astronomical composition taken over several nights in April from [Rio Hurtado](https://youtu.be/NKXFq0LBPgU), [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile).
