Why would a small part of the Sun appear slightly dark? Visible is a close-up picture of [sunspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot)s, depressions on the Sun's surface that are [slightly cooler](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/c603f47c-58c5-486a-bf37-e2b49a90c683_1.6d76034b23dfb94fd850ac8bd4f51a62.jpeg) and less bright than the rest of the Sun. The Sun's complex [magnetic field](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/understanding-the-magnetic-sun) creates these cool regions by inhibiting hot material from entering the spots. [Sunspots](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150629.html) can be larger than the Earth and typically last for about a week. Part of active region AR [3297](https://spaceweather.com/images2023/07may23/hmi1898.gif) crossing the [Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/) in early May, the large lower sunspot is spanned by an impressive [light bridge](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000522.html) of hot and suspended solar gas. This high-resolution picture also shows clearly that the [Sun's surface](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/sun-space-weather/surface-of-the-sun) is a bubbling carpet of separate cells of hot gas. These cells are known as [granules](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111106.html). A [solar granule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_granule) is about 1000 kilometers across and [lasts](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200203.html) for only about 15 minutes.
