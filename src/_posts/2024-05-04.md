Despite their resemblance to [R2D2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxVHsWlE7hE), these three are not the droids you're looking for. Instead, the enclosures house 1.8 meter [Auxiliary Telescopes](http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/telescopes/vlti/at/) (ATs) at Paranal Observatory in the [Atacama Desert](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/144989/atacama-greening) region of Chile. The ATs are designed to be used [for interferometry](http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/telescopes/vlti/at/), a technique for achieving extremely high resolution observations, in concert with the observatory's 8 meter [Very Large Telescope units](http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/telescopes/vlti/index.html). A total of four ATs are operational, each fitted with a transporter [that moves](http://gerardstravelnotes.blogspot.com/2008/01/holy-moving-telescopes-batman.html) the telescope along a track allowing different arrays with the large unit telescopes. To work as an interferometer, the light from each telescope is brought to a common focal point by a system of mirrors in underground tunnels. Above these three ATs, the Large and Small [Magellanic Clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060809.html) are the far, far away satellite galaxies of our own Milky Way. In the clear and otherwise dark southern skies, planet Earth's greenish atmospheric [airglow stretches](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110817.html) faintly along the horizon.
