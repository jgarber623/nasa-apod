When stars form, pandemonium reigns. A [textbook](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/21-1-star-formation) case is the star forming region [NGC 6559](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_6559). Visible in the [featured image](https://www.adamblockphotos.com/ngc-6559.html) are red glowing [emission nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_nebula)s of [hydrogen](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/hydrogen/index.html), blue [reflection nebulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_nebula) of [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html), dark [absorption nebulas](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/D/Dark+Nebula) of dust, and the stars that formed from them. The [first massive stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030610.html) formed from the dense gas will emit [energetic light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) and [winds](https://esahubble.org/wordbank/stellar-wind/) that erode, fragment, and [sculpt](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070606.html) their birthplace. And then they [explode](http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html). The resulting [morass](https://sounddogconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Toilet-Paper-660x371.jpg) can be as beautiful as it is [complex](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200706.html). After tens of millions of years, the dust [boils](https://youtu.be/1uUFI0w5Tj0) away, the gas gets swept away, and all that is left is a bare [open cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cluster) of stars.
