[A great nebulous region](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1915ApJ....41..253B/abstract) near bright star omicron Persei offers this study in cosmic contrasts. Captured in [the telescopic frame](https://www.astrobin.com/s5xyxm/) the colorful complex of dust, gas, and stars spans about 3 degrees on the sky along the edge of the [Perseus molecular cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_molecular_cloud) some 1000 light-years away. Surrounded by a bluish halo of dust reflected starlight, omicron Persei itself is just left of center. Immediately below it lies the intriguing young star cluster IC 348 [recently explored](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240115.html) by the James Webb Space Telescope. In silhouette against the diffuse reddish glow of [hydrogen gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050930.html), dark and obscuring interstellar dust cloud Barnard 3 is at upper right. Of course the cosmic dust also tends to hide newly formed stars and young stellar objects or protostars from prying optical telescopes. At the Perseus molecular cloud's [estimated](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3393) distance, this field of view would span about 50 light-years.
