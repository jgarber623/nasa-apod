A jewel of the [southern sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210101.html), the [Great Carina Nebula](http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n3372.html) is more modestly known as NGC 3372. One of our [Galaxy's](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) largest star forming regions, it spans over 300 light-years. Like the smaller, more northerly [Great Orion Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240105.html), the [Carina Nebula](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2007/news-2007-16.html) is easily visible to the unaided eye. But at a distance of 7,500 light-years it lies some 5 times farther away. This stunning telescopic view reveals remarkable details of the region's glowing filaments of [interstellar gas](http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html) and [obscuring cosmic dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080528.html) clouds. The [Carina Nebula](https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1637/) is home to young, extremely massive stars, including the still enigmatic variable [Eta Carinae](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230709.html), a star with well over 100 times the mass of the Sun. [Eta Carinae](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/etacar.html) is the bright star above the central dark notch in this field and left of the [dusty Keyhole](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160814.html) Nebula (NGC 3324).
