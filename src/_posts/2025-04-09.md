What's at the tip of this interstellar jet? First let's consider the jet: it is being expelled by a [star system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AJ....132.1923B/abstract) just forming and is cataloged as [Herbig-Haro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbig%E2%80%93Haro_object) 49 (HH 49). The [star system](https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/nasas-webb-telescope-reveals-cosmic-tornado-in-action/) expelling this jet is [not visible](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fh21s6uzy9qi11.jpg) -- it is off to the lower right. The complex conical structure [featured](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2025/112/01JNGTQ49XY0NHG1Y31RAGYH1Y) in this infrared image by the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/) also includes another jet cataloged as HH 50. The fast jet particles impact the [surrounding](https://youtu.be/J7tPEOVGKkw) interstellar gas and form shock waves that glow prominently in [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) light -- shown here as reddish-brown ridges. This [JWST image](https://youtu.be/U_GviglW954) also resolved the mystery of the unusual object at [HH 49](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070811.html)'s tip: it is a [spiral galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240101.html) far in the distance. The blue center is therefore not one star but many, and the surrounding circular rings are actually [spiral arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_arm)s.
