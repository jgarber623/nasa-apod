What is that unusual red halo surrounding this aurora? It is a Stable Auroral Red (SAR) arc. [SAR arc](https://www.windows2universe.org/glossary/aurora_SARARC.html)s are rare and have only been acknowledged and studied since 1954. The [featured wide-angle photograph](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0e1DEXPQzR/), capturing nearly an entire [SAR arc](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231111.html) surrounding more common green and red aurora, was taken earlier this month from [Poolburn](https://youtu.be/DLxQsUAXKag), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand), during an especially energetic [geomagnetic storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm). Why [SAR arcs](https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2021/11/22/3308/) form remains a topic of [research](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015JA021722), but is likely related to [Earth's protective magnetic field](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/planetary-science/earths-magnetosphere/), a field created by [molten iron](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/385388/even-if-molten-iron-is-ionized-spins-how-does-it-make-a-mag-field) flowing deep inside the [Earth](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/menu/earth/). This magnetic field usually redirects incoming charged particles from the [Sun's wind](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000318.html) toward the Earth's poles. However, it also traps a [ring of ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_current) closer to the equator, where they can gain energy from the [magnetosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/magnetosphere-ionosphere/) during high [solar activity](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160731.html). The energetic electrons in this [ion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion) ring can collide with and excite oxygen higher in [Earth's ionosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/10-things-to-know-about-the-ionosphere/) than typical [auroras](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230730.html), causing the oxygen to glow red. [Ongoing research](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL101205) has uncovered evidence that a red SAR arc [can even transform](https://allthingslearning.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/dogs_surprised.jpg) into a [purple and](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230927.html) green [STEVE](https://eos.org/research-spotlights/from-sar-arc-to-steve-an-atmospheric-evolution).
