What's that at the end of the road? The Sun. Many towns have roads that run east-west, and on two days each year, the Sun rises and sets [right down the middle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100321.html). Today, in some parts of the world (tomorrow in others), is one of those days: an [equinox](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210922.html). Not only is this a day of equal night [("aequus"-"nox")](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/equinox#Etymology) and day time, but also a day when the [sun rises](http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-vernal-or-spring-equinox) precisely to the east and sets due west. Displayed here is a picturesque rural road in [Alberta](https://youtu.be/COtpTM1MpAA), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) that runs approximately east-west. The [featured image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/amazingsky/51508883089/in/pool-apods/) was taken during the September [Equinox](https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/tag/equinox/) of 2021, but the geometry remains the same every year. In many cultures, this [March equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox) is taken to be the first day of a season, typically spring in Earth's [northern hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere), and autumn in the [south](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap951222.html). Does your [favorite street](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/02/c2/09/02c20915a2e492de284d537ec0a4825e.jpg) run east-west? Tonight, at sunset, you can [find out](https://www.google.com/search?q=when+is+the+march+equinox+2024) with a quick glance.
