No, the Moon is not a bow, and no, it did not shoot out a plane like an arrow. What is pictured is a chance superposition. The plane's [contrail](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/sensing-our-planet/on-the-trail-of-contrails) would normally appear white, but the large volume of air toward the rising Sun preferentially knocked away blue light, not only making the [sky blue](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/), but giving the reflected trail a bright [red hue](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050711.html). Far in the distance, well behind [the plane](https://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=airplane), the [crescent Moon](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-phases/en/) also appears slightly reddened. Captured early last month from [Bolton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton), [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), the featured image was taken so soon after sunrise that the plane was sunlit from below, as was its contrail. Within minutes, unfortunately, the impromptu sky [show ended](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/world/17grumpycat-1/17grumpycat-1-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg). The plane moved out of sight. The [Moon](https://moon.nasa.gov/) kept rising but became harder to see through a brightening sky. And the [contrail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap041013.html) gradually dispersed.
