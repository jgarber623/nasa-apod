Like an illustration in a galactic [Just So Story](http://www.boop.org/jan/justso/elephant.htm), the Elephant's Trunk Nebula winds through the emission region and young star cluster [complex IC 1396](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050908.html), in the high and far off constellation [of Cepheus](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/cep/). Seen on the left the cosmic elephant's trunk, also known as vdB 142, is over 20 light-years long. This detailed telescopic view features the bright swept-back ridges and pockets of cool [interstellar](http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html) dust and gas that abound in the region. But the [dark, tendril-shaped clouds](https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/image/ssc2003-06b-dark-globule-in-ic-1396) contain the raw material for star formation and hide [protostars within](https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3013). Nearly 3,000 [light-years distant](http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cosmic/), the relatively faint IC 1396 complex covers a large region on the sky, spanning over 5 degrees. [This rendition](http://www.starrywonders.com/ic1396ASI294small.html) spans a 1 degree wide field of view though, about the angular size of 2 full moons. [Of course](http://www.boop.org/jan/justso/) the dark shapes below and to the right of the outstretched Elephant's Trunk, are known to some as The Caravan.
