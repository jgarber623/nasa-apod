Watch Juno zoom past Jupiter. [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s robotic spacecraft [Juno](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno) is continuing on its now month-long, highly-[elongated orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit) around our Solar System's largest planet. The featured video is from perijove 16, the sixteenth time that [Juno](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/spacecraft/) passed near Jupiter since it arrived in mid-2016. Each [perijove](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/perijove) passes near a [slightly different part](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-re-plans-junos-jupiter-mission) of Jupiter's cloud tops. This [color-enhanced video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsGW2JZrMnY) has been digitally composed from 21 JunoCam still images, resulting in a 125-fold time-lapse. [The video](https://youtu.be/c4TU3arrZR8) begins with Jupiter rising as [Juno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)) [approaches](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170523.html) from the north. As Juno reaches its [closest view](https://media.giphy.com/media/1050MHNmEr19C0/giphy.gif) -- from about 3,500 kilometers over Jupiter's cloud tops -- the spacecraft captures the great planet in tremendous detail. [Juno](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/) passes light zones and dark belts of clouds that circle the planet, as well as numerous swirling circular storms, many of which are larger than [hurricanes on Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171127.html). As Juno moves away, the remarkable [dolphin-shaped cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190415.html) is visible. After the perijove, [Jupiter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220830.html) recedes into the distance, now displaying the unusual clouds that appear over Jupiter's south. To get desired [science data](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/science-findings/), Juno swoops so close to [Jupiter](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/) that its instruments are exposed to very high levels of [radiation](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/analog-field-testing/why-space-radiation-matters/).
