Sometimes, the surface of our Sun seems to dance. In the middle of 2012, for example, NASA's Sun-orbiting [Solar Dynamic Observatory](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/sdo) spacecraft imaged an [impressive prominence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030223.html) that seemed to perform a [running dive roll](https://youtu.be/VzALZjoIx0g?t=225) like an acrobatic dancer. The dramatic explosion was [captured](http://cometal-comets.blogspot.com/2012/08/sdo-spinning-plasma.html?m=1) in [ultraviolet light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) in the [featured time-lapse video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQFEHH5E69s) covering about three hours. A looping [magnetic field](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/the_key.shtml) directed the flow of hot [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_\(physics\)) on the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/). The scale of the [dancing prominence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000809.html) is huge -- the entire [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170709.html) would easily fit under the flowing [arch](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170429.html) of hot gas. A quiescent [prominence typically](http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Program/hfilament.html) lasts about a month and may erupt in a [Coronal Mass Ejection](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections) (CME), [expelling hot gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010924.html) into the [Solar System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Solar_System). The energy mechanism that creates a [solar prominence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030707.html) is still a topic of [research](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJ...600.1043Z). Like in 2012, this year the Sun's surface is again [quite active](https://images.pond5.com/funny-active-naughty-dog-after-footage-243101380_iconl.jpeg) and features many [filaments and prominences](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240615.html).
