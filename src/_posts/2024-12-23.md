It was December and the sky lit up like a Christmas tree. Shimmering, the vivid green, blue, and purple [auroral colors](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a004900/a004934/Different_Colors_of_Auroras.pdf) that formed the tree-like apparition were caused by high atmospheric [oxygen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml) and [nitrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/7.shtml) reacting to a burst of incoming electrons. Collisions caused the orbital [electrons](https://www.aps.org/apsnews/2000/10/discovery-of-the-electron) of atoms and molecules to [jump into excited energy states](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/m3C7Pv9u2l0) and emit [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) when returning to their normal state. The featured image was captured in [Dj√∫pivogur](https://youtu.be/nDxwPAyCXK4), [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland) during the last month of 2023. Our [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) is currently in its [most energetic phase](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-noaa-sun-reaches-maximum-phase-in-11-year-solar-cycle/) of its 11-year cycle, with its high number of [active regions and sunspots](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141022.html) likely to last into next year. Of course, the Sun has been near [solar maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum) during this entire year, with its [outbursts](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240818.html) sometimes resulting in [spectacular](http://funkot.ru/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kotik-v-shapochke.jpg) Earthly [auroras](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240612.html).
