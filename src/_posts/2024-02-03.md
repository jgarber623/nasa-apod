Apollo 14's Lunar Module Antares [landed on the Moon](https://www.nasa.gov/history/50-years-ago-apollo-14-lands-at-fra-mauro/) on February 5, 1971. Toward the end of the stay astronaut [Ed Mitchell](http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/A14Mitchell-FlownSuit.html) snapped [a series of photos](http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/images14.html#9335) of the lunar surface while looking out a window, [assembled](http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/images14.html#Pans) into this detailed mosaic by [Apollo Lunar Surface Journal](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/) editor Eric Jones. The view looks across the [Fra Mauro highlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_14) to the northwest of the landing site after the Apollo 14 astronauts had completed their second and final [walk on the Moon](http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/a14.clsout2.html). Prominent in the foreground is their Modular Equipment Transporter, a two-wheeled, rickshaw-like device used to carry tools and samples. Near the horizon at top center is a 1.5 meter wide boulder dubbed Turtle rock. In the shallow crater below Turtle rock is the long white handle of a sampling instrument, thrown there javelin-style by Mitchell. Mitchell's fellow moonwalker and first American in space, [Alan Shepard](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010505.html), also used a makeshift six iron to hit [two golf balls](http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/a14.clsout2.html#1350811). One of Shepard's golf balls is just visible as a white spot [below Mitchell's javelin](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/static/history/alsj/a14/AS14-66-9337HR.jpg).
