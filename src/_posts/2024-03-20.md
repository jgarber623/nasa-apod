Across the heart of the [Virgo Galaxy Cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230526.html) lies a string of galaxies known as [Markarian's Chain](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210522.html). Prominent in [Markarian's Chain](https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/astrophotography/galaxies/markarians-chain) are these two [interacting galaxies](https://youtu.be/7MKCZJYChmE), NGC 4438 (left) and NGC 4435 - also known as The Eyes. About 50 million [light-year](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/faq/26/what-is-a-light-year/)s away, the two galaxies appear to be about 100,000 light-years apart in [this sharp close-up](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4fgJ9puFQL/), but have likely approached to within an estimated 16,000 light-years of each other in their [cosmic past](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_lookback.html). Gravitational tides from [the close encounter](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2003/ngc4438/) have ripped away at their stars, gas, and dust. The more massive NGC 4438 managed to hold on to much of the material torn out in the [collision](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130514.html), while material from the smaller NGC 4435 was more [easily lost](https://www.pawschicago.org/fileadmin/_processed_/0/1/csm__MG_7375_b9fb882943.jpg). The remarkably deep image of this crowded region [of the universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220316.html) also includes many more [distant background galaxies](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30946).
