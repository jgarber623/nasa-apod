Where else might life exist? One of humanity's [great outstanding questions](https://apod.nasa.gov/debate/debate100th.html), locating planets where extrasolar life might survive took a step forward in 2019 with the discovery of a significant amount of water vapor in the atmosphere of distant exoplanet [K2-18b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2-18b). The planet and its parent star, [K2-18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2-18), lie about 124 light years away toward the constellation of the [Lion](http://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1wvWmKxSYBuNjSspjq6x73VXay.jpg_q50.jpg) ([Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(constellation))). The [exoplanet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190710.html) is significantly larger and more massive than our Earth, but orbits in the [habitable zone](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/habitable-zones-of-different-stars) of its home star. K2-18, although more red than our Sun, shines in [K2-18b](https://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/heic1916a/)'s sky with a brightness similar to the [Sun in Earth's sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150512.html). The 2019 [discovery of atmospheric water](https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2019/09/11/water-detected-on-an-exoplanet-located-in-its-star-s-habitable-zone/) was made in data from three space telescopes: [Hubble](https://hubblesite.org/mission-and-telescope/the-telescope), [Spitzer](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/main/index.html), and [Kepler](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/spacecraft/index.html), by noting the absorption of water-vapor colors when the [planet moved in front](http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/transit-photometry.html) of the star. Now in 2023, [further observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05566) by the [Webb Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/webb/main/index.html) in [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) have uncovered evidence of other life-indicating molecules -- including [methane](https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/methane-stinks-earth-mars-and-beyond). The featured illustration imagines exoplanet [K2-18b](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/2023/webb-discovers-methane-carbon-dioxide-in-atmosphere-of-k2-18b) on the far right orbited by a moon (center), which together orbit a [red dwarf star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf) depicted on the lower left.
