Yes, but have you ever seen a sunrise like this? Here, after initial cloudiness, [the Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) appeared to rise in two pieces and during a partial eclipse in 2019, causing the photographer to describe it as the most stunning sunrise of his life. The dark circle near the top of the [atmospherically-reddened Sun](https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/about/redsky/) is [the Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/) -- but so is the dark peak just below it. This is because along the way, the [Earth's atmosphere](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2919/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/) had a layer of unusually warm air over the sea which acted like a [gigantic lens](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211228.html) and created a [second image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0344/6469/files/twincats.png). For a normal sunrise or sunset, this rare phenomenon of [atmospheric optics](https://www.atoptics.co.uk/) is known as the [Etruscan vase effect](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090223.html). The [featured picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/B68KArFlUnr/) was [captured](https://www.boredpanda.com/sunrise-red-horns-solar-eclipse-elias-chasiotis/) in December 2019 from [Al Wakrah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Wakrah), [Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar). Some observers in a narrow band of [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts) to the east were able to see a [full annular solar eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120519.html) -- where the Moon appears completely surrounded by the background Sun in a [ring of fire](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230910.html). The next solar eclipse, also an annular eclipse for well-placed observers, will [occur this coming Saturday](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2023/where-when/).
