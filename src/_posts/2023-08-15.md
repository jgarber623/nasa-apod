The Sun is [not the quiet place](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230711.html) it seems. [It](https://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/data/realtime-images.html) expels an unsteady stream of energetic [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron)s and [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton)s known as the [solar wind](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/2288/the-solar-wind-across-our-solar-system/). These charged particles deform the [Earth's magnetosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/multimedia/magnetosphere.html), change paths, and collide with atoms in [Earth's atmosphere](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/atmosphere/en/), causing the generation of light in [auroras](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230704.html) like that visible in [green](https://www.theaurorazone.com/about-the-aurora/the-science-of-the-northern-lights/the-northern-lights-colours) in the image left. Earth itself is also [geologically active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_Earth) and covered with [volcanoes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210303.html). For example, [Fagradalsfjall](https://youtu.be/DQx96G4yHd8) volcano in [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland), seen emitting hot gas in orange near the image center. Iceland is one of the most [geologically active places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_Reykjanes_Peninsula) on Earth. On the far right is the [Svartsengi geothermal power plant](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/svartsengi) which creates the famous human-made [Blue Lagoon](https://www.insider.com/icelands-blue-lagoon-man-made-2017-11), shown emitting white gas plumes. The [featured composition](https://www.instagram.com/p/CukPkBPo5b3/) therefore highlights [three different sky phenomena](https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/01/89/49/89/1000_F_189498933_OeutsN0mMlzJGaJZJvkXIsoSCUCFIO7W.jpg), including both natural and human-made phenomena.
