What's happened to the Moon? Within the last day, part of the Moon moved through the [Earth's shadow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211125.html). This happens about [once or twice a year](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/2024), but not every month since the Moon's orbit around the Earth is [slightly tilted](https://earthsky.org/upl/2017/07/moon.orbit_-e1498934371864.jpg). Pictured here, the face of a full [Hunter's Moon](https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a45629701/what-is-a-hunters-moon/) is shown twice from [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) during this partial [lunar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/lunar-phases-and-eclipses/). On the left, most of the Moon appears over[exposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography)) except for the eclipsed bottom right, which shows some familiar [lunar surface](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html) details. In contrast, on the right, most of the (same) [Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200719.html) appears normally exposed, with the exception of the bottom right, which now appears dark. All [lunar eclipses](https://mars.nasa.gov/images/Lunar_eclipse_sideview.jpg) are visible from the half of the [Earth](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-earth/en/) facing the Moon at the time of the eclipse, but [this eclipse](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/lunar/2023-october-28) was [visible](https://c.tadst.com/gfx/eclipses2/20231028/anim2d-380.mp4) specifically from [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa), [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia), and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), clouds [permitting](https://live.staticflickr.com/8494/8298383476_bd8d1bc879_b.jpg). In April, a [total solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/) will be visible from [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America).
