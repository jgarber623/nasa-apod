Sometimes a river of hot gas flows over your head. In this case the river created a Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement ([STEVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEVE)) that glowed bright red, white, and pink. Details of [how STEVEs work](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018GeoRL..45.7968G/abstract) remain a topic of research, but recent evidence holds that their glow results from a [fast-moving river of hot ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEVE#Research_into_cause) flowing over a hundred kilometers up in the [Earth's atmosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-atmosphere/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/): the [ionosphere](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/10-things-to-know-about-the-ionosphere/). The more expansive dull red glow might be related to the flowing [STEVE](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210505.html), but alternatively might be a [Stable Auroral Red](https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2021/11/22/3308/) (SAR) arc, a [more](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240103.html) general heat-related glow. The [featured picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBKEFJlMLPo/), taken earlier this month in [Côte d'Opale](https://youtu.be/66ATFjFDjoY?t=129), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), is a wide-angle digital composite made as the [STEVE arc](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171014.html) formed nearly overhead. Although the [apparition](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231022.html) lasted only a few minutes, this was long enough for the [quick-thinking](https://static2.bigstockphoto.com/0/7/4/large1500/470325001.jpg) astrophotographer to get in the picture -- can you find him?
