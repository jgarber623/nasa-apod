The tardigrade has no apparent eyes, a light brown body, a circular gear-like snout, and claws at the end of its numerous feet. The tardigrade is seen perched on green moss.

Is this an alien? Probably not, but of all the animals on Earth, the [tardigrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade) might be the best candidate. That's because [tardigrades](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0E77TdYnY) are known to be able to go for decades without food or water, to survive temperatures from near [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero) to well above the boiling point of water, to survive pressures from near zero to well above that on [ocean floors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed), and to survive direct exposure to dangerous [radiations](https://srag.jsc.nasa.gov/SpaceRadiation/What/What.cfm). The far-ranging survivability of these [extremophiles](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090830.html) was [tested](http://tardigradesinspace.blogspot.com/) in 2011 _outside_ an orbiting space shuttle. [Tardigrades](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W194GQ6fHI) are so durable partly because they can repair their own [DNA](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120821.html) and reduce their body water content to a few percent. Some of these [miniature water-bears](https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/scientists-finally-figure-out-why-the-water-bear-is-nearly-unstoppable/) almost _became_ extraterrestrials in 2011 when they were launched toward to the Martian moon [Phobos](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121028.html), and again in 2021 when they were launched toward Earth's own moon, but the [former](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Interplanetary_Flight_Experiment) launch failed, and the [latter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beresheet) landing crashed. [Tardigrades](http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/tardigrade/index.html) are more common than [human](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190818.html)s across most of the Earth.
