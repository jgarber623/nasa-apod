While hunting for comets in the skies above 18th century France, [astronomer Charles Messier](https://science.nasa.gov/people/explore-the-night-sky-hubbleatms-messier-catalog-bio/) diligently kept a list of the things encountered during his telescopic expeditions that were definitely not comets. This is number 27 on his [now famous not-a-comet list](http://messier.seds.org/xtra/history/m-cat.html). In fact, 21st century astronomers would identify it as a [planetary nebula](http://messier.seds.org/planetar.html), but it's not a planet either, even though it may [appear round](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030614.html) and planet-like in a small telescope. Messier 27 (M27) is an excellent example of a gaseous emission nebula created as a [sun-like star runs out](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100221.html) of nuclear fuel in its core. The nebula forms as the star's outer layers are expelled into space, with a visible glow generated by atoms excited by the dying star's intense but invisible [ultraviolet light](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum1.html). Known by the popular name of the [Dumbbell Nebula](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-27/), the beautifully symmetric interstellar gas cloud is over 2.5 light-years across and about 1,200 light-years away in the [constellation Vulpecula](http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/vul/index.html). This impressive color image highlights details within the well-studied central region and fainter, seldom imaged features in the nebula's [outer halo](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100509.html).
