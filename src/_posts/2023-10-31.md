[Halloween's origin](https://www.history.com/topics/halloween/history-of-halloween) is ancient and astronomical. Since the fifth century BC, [Halloween](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween) has been celebrated as a [cross-quarter day](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/halloween-derived-from-ancient-celtic-cross-quarter-day/), a day halfway between an [equinox](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/september-equinox.html) (equal day / equal night) and a [solstice](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220321.html) (minimum day / maximum night in the northern hemisphere). With a [modern calendar](https://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-countries.html) however, even though Halloween occurs today, the real cross-[quarter day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_days) will occur [next week](https://sonrisaeast.com/quarter-sun-cross-quarter-calendar/). Another cross-quarter day is [Groundhog Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day)[.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZbtAFq7dP8) Halloween's modern celebration retains [historic roots](https://www.neopagan.net/Halloween-Origins.html) in [dressing to scare](https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/halloween-cat-costumes-19-57f75fe01d15b__605.jpg) away the spirits of the dead. Perhaps a fitting tribute to this ancient holiday is [this closeup view](https://www.astrobin.com/kt2rv5/) of the [Wizard Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7380) (NGC 7380). Visually, the interplay of stars, gas, and dust has created a shape that appears to some like a [fictional ancient sorcerer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magician_(fantasy)#/media/File:Arthur-Pyle_The_Enchanter_Merlin.JPG). Although the nebula may last only a few million years, some of the [stars being conjured](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/) from the gas by the [great gravitational powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_collapse) may [outlive](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Astro/startime.html) our Sun.
