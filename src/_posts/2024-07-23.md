What powers the Crab Nebula? A city-sized magnetized [neutron star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030201.html) spinning around 30 times a second. Known as the [Crab Pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_Pulsar), it is the bright spot in the center of the gaseous swirl at the nebula's core. About 10 light-years across, the [spectacular picture](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9047697920/hF7BB9AC7/) of the [Crab Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_Nebula) (M1) frames a swirling central disk and complex filaments of surrounding and expanding glowing gas. The picture combines [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) from the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/about-hubble/) in red and blue with [X-ray light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays/) from the [Chandra X-ray Observatory](https://chandra.harvard.edu/about/) shown in white, and diffuse X-ray emission detected by [Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer](https://www.nasa.gov/ixpe-overview/) (IXPE) in diffuse purple. The central [pulsar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210209.html) powers the [Crab Nebula](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02968)'s emission and [expansion](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230320.html) by slightly slowing its spin rate, which drives out a [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind) of energetic [electrons](https://www.aps.org/archives/publications/apsnews/200010/history.cfm). The [featured image](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2024/25th/more.html) released today, the [25th Anniversary](https://chandra.harvard.edu/25th/) of the [launch](https://youtu.be/al0Ol3rGthE) of NASA's [flagship-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_large_strategic_science_missions) X-ray Observatory: [Chandra](https://chandra.harvard.edu/).
