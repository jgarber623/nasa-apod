Like Earth's moon, [Saturn's largest moon Titan](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/saturn-moons/titan/in-depth/) is locked in synchronous rotation with its planet. [This mosaic](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19642) of images recorded by the Cassini spacecraft in May of 2012 shows its anti-Saturn side, the side [always facing](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161230.html) away from the ringed gas giant. The only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere, Titan is the only [solar system world](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141124.html) besides Earth known to have standing bodies of liquid on its surface and an earthlike cycle of [liquid rain](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110401.html) and evaporation. Its high altitude layer of atmospheric haze is evident in the Cassini view of the 5,000 kilometer diameter moon over Saturn's rings and cloud tops. [Near center is](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20713) the dark dune-filled region known as [Shangri-La](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/17499/dunes-of-shangri-la-on-titan/). The Cassini-delivered Huygens probe rests below and left of center, after the [most distant landing](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150116.html) for a spacecraft from Earth.
