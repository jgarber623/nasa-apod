Riding high in the constellation of Auriga, beautiful, blue VdB 31 is the 31st [object](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121026.html) in Sidney van den Bergh's 1966 [catalog of reflection nebulae](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1966AJ.....71..990V). It shares this well-composed celestial still life with dark, obscuring clouds B26, B27, and B28, recorded in Edward E. Barnard's 1919 [catalog of dark markings](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1919ApJ....49....1B) in the sky. All are these nebulae are interstellar dust clouds. Barnard's [dark nebulae](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161225.html) block the light from background stars. For VdB 31 the dust preferentially reflects bluish starlight from embedded, hot, variable star AB Aurigae. Exploring the [environs of AB Aurigae](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-016) with the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed the several million year young star is itself surrounded by a flattened [dusty disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141110.html) with [evidence](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241203923S/abstract) for the ongoing formation of a planetary system. AB Aurigae is about 470 light-years away. At that distance [this cosmic canvas](https://www.astrobin.com/ezjp1j/) would span about eight light-years.
