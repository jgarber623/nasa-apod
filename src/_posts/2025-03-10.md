Could [Queen Calafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calafia)'s mythical island exist in space? Perhaps not, but by chance the outline of this molecular space cloud echoes the outline of the state of [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), USA. Our [Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140506.html) has its home within the Milky Way's [Orion Arm](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/5000lys.html), only about 1,000 light-years from the [California Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Nebula). Also known as [NGC 1499](https://spider.seds.org/spider/Misc/n1499.html), the classic emission nebula is around 100 [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/)s long. On the [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DFncpPQsfOJ/), the most prominent glow of the California Nebula is the red light characteristic of [hydrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml) atoms recombining with [long lost](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/lament.html) electrons, stripped away ([ionized](https://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/3/3d/IONIZATION.png)) by energetic starlight. The star most likely providing the [energetic starlight](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) that [ionizes](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/ion-balloons/en/) much of the nebular gas is the bright, hot, bluish [Xi Persei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Persei) just to the right of the nebula. A regular target for astrophotographers, the California Nebula [can be spotted](https://www.rover.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/curious-cat-looking-in-a-box.jpg) with a wide-field telescope under a dark sky toward the constellation of [Perseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_%28constellation%29), not far from the [Pleiades](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220405.html).
