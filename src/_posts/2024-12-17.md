What excites the Heart Nebula? First, the large [emission nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/emission_nebulae.html) on the upper left, catalogued as [IC 1805](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040917.html), looks somewhat like a [human heart](https://youtu.be/xWkeidr2T8o?t=26). The nebula glows brightly in red light emitted by its [most prominent](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/5d/63/d35d632b0161e3169f7f4dd3c17c8e36.jpg) element, [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen), but this long-exposure image was also blended with light emitted by sulfur (yellow) and oxygen (blue). In the [center of the Heart Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180214.html) are young stars from the open star cluster [Melotte 15](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131227.html) that are eroding away several picturesque [dust pillars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241022.html) with their atom-exciting [energetic light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) and winds. The [Heart Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031022.html) is located about 7,500 [light years](http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html) away toward the [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/en/) of [Cassiopeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_\(constellation\)). This [wide field image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DC1wDJZvRO8/) shows much more, though, including the [Fishhead Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240501.html) just below the Heart, a [supernova remnant](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/objects/snrs/snrstext.html) on the lower left, and three [planetary nebulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula) on the image right. Taken over 57 nights, [this image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DC1wDJZvRO8/) is so deep, though, that it clearly shows fainter long and complex filaments.
