How does a total solar eclipse end? Yes, the Moon moves out from fully [blocking the Sun](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/solar-eclipse-diagram/), but in the first few seconds of transition, [interesting things appear](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-24a2197245b616b1b04c4fbd4744c471-pjlq). The first is called a [diamond ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201218.html). Light might stream between mountains or through relative lowlands around the [Moon's edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_limb), as seen from your location, making this sudden first light, when combined with the [corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240402.html) that surrounds the [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/), look like a [diamond ring](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Classic_Diamond_Engagement_Ring.jpg). Within seconds other light streams appear that are called, collectively, [Bailey's beads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baily%27s_beads). In the [featured video](https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidduarte_astro/53645501807/in/pool-apods/), it may seem that the [pink triangular prominence](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=413131944748722&set=a.410844681644115) on the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) is somehow related to where the Sun begins to reappear, but it is not. Observers from other locations saw [Bailey's beads](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150328.html) emerge from different places around the Moon, away from the iconic triangular [solar prominence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230801.html) visible to all. The video was captured with specialized equipment from [New Boston](https://youtu.be/Fo0tD-xNteQ?t=11), [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) on April 8, 2024.
