Beautiful emission nebula NGC 6164 was created by a rare, hot, luminous [O-type](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/startype.html) star, some 40 times as massive as the Sun. Seen at the center of the cosmic cloud, the star is a mere 3 to 4 million years old. In another three to four million years the massive star will end its life in a [supernova explosion](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250108.html). Spanning around 4 light-years, [the nebula itself](http://www.gemini.edu/node/188) has a bipolar symmetry. That makes it similar in appearance to more common and familiar [planetary nebulae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula) - the gaseous shrouds [surrounding](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120831.html) dying sun-like stars. Also like many planetary nebulae, NGC 6164 has been found to have an extensive, [faint halo](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1985PASP...97..780F&), revealed in this deep image of the region. Expanding into the surrounding [interstellar medium](http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html), the material in the halo is likely from an earlier active phase of the O star. [This gorgeous telescopic view](https://app.astrobin.com/u/dstern?i=rj65f5#gallery) is a composite of extensive narrow-band image data, highlighting glowing atomic hydrogen gas in red and oxygen in greenish hues, with broad-band data for the surrounding starfield. Also known as the [Dragon's Egg nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220607.html), NGC 6164 is 4,200 light-years away in the right-angled southern constellation [of Norma](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/nor/index.html).
