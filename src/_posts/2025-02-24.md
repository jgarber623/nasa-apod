Can a lava flow extend into the sky? No, but light from the lava flow can. One effect is something quite unusual -- a volcanic [light pillar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pillar). More typically, light pillars are caused by sunlight and so appear as a bright column that extends upward above a rising or setting [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/facts/). Alternatively, other light pillars -- [some](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181024.html) [quite](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160208.html) [colorful](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131218.html) -- have been recorded above street and house lights. This light [pillar](https://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/pillar.htm), though, was illuminated by the red light emitted by the glowing magma of an [erupting volcano](https://youtu.be/z01KTFhA34o). The volcano is [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy)'s [Mount Etna](https://youtu.be/gbRdvpTdQdI), and the [featured image](https://youtu.be/YqbNdDxa_i4) was captured with a single shot during an early morning in mid-February. Freezing temperatures above the volcano's [lava flow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190512.html) created [ice-crystals](https://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/platcol.htm) either in the air above the volcano or in condensed water vapor expelled by [Mount Etna](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030416.html). These [ice crystals](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/07/science/07tb-lightpillars-diagram/07tb-lightpillars-jumbo.jpg) -- mostly [flat toward the ground](https://mrbosscat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-lying-flat-on-stomach-1536x864.jpg) but fluttering -- then reflected away light from the [volcano's caldera](https://youtu.be/gbRdvpTdQdI).
