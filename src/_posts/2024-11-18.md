Stars can create huge and intricate [dust sculptures](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220925.html) from the dense and dark [molecular cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html)s from which they are born. The tools the stars use to carve their detailed works are [high energy light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) and fast [stellar winds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000318.html). The heat they generate evaporates the dark molecular [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_dust) as well as causing ambient [hydrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml) gas to disperse and [glow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/emission_nebulae.html). [Pictured here](https://www.astrobin.com/z1ex5r/), a new open cluster of stars designated [IC 1590](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_1590) is nearing completion around the intricate [interstellar dust structures](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210307.html) in the emission nebula [NGC 281](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_281), dubbed the [Pac-man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-man) Nebula because of its [overall shape](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181122.html). The [dust cloud](https://insidenanabreadshead.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dust-bunny.jpg) just above center is classified as a [Bok Globule](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030127.html) as it may [gravitationally collapse](https://youtu.be/YbdwTwB8jtc) and form a star -- or stars. The Pacman Nebula lies about 10,000 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) away toward the [constellation of Cassiopeia](https://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/cassiopeia-constellation/).
