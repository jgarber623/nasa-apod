Yes, but can your aurora do this? First, yes, [auroras](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/) can look like [rainbows](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140930.html) even though they are completely different phenomena. Auroras are caused by Sun-created particles being channeled into [Earth's atmosphere](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2919/earths-atmosphere-a-multi-layered-cake/) by [Earth's magnetic field](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/earths-magnetosphere-3/), and [create colors](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/20056) by exciting [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom)s at different heights. Conversely, [rainbows are created](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/rainbow/) by sunlight backscattering off falling raindrops, and different colors are [refracted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction) by slightly different angles. [Unfortunately](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/854269380/photo/golden-retriever-face-and-hand.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=AzjIMNJB3PqXciBWggT64jmFwCgPw8FTWllTFzf48rM=), auroras can’t create waterfalls, but if you plan well and are lucky enough, you can photograph them together. The [featured picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0j1H5wsAAr/) is composed of several images taken on the same night last month near the [Skógafoss waterfall](https://youtu.be/-eejVvSLQfk) in [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland). The planning centered on capturing the [central band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230620.html) of our [Milky Way galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) over the [picturesque](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230704.html) [cascade](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211101.html). By luck, a [spectacular aurora soon appeared](https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad12683c000032000b0e42.jpeg) just below the curving arch of the Milky Way. Far in the background, the [Pleiades star cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades) and the [Andromeda](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231113.html) galaxy can be found.
