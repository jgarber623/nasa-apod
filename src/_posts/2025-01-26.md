Why does this comet have so many tails? [C/2024 G3 (ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_G3_\(ATLAS\)) has developed several long and intricate tails visible from Earth's southern hemisphere over the past two weeks. Many observers reported seeing the [impressive](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fgfkvsovdq4l21.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dd24871a13ae2249f7681f845e63e636098a85c84) comet without any [optical aid](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250124.html) above the western horizon just after sunset. At least six different tails appear in the featured image captured five days ago from the dark skies above [Paranal Observatory](https://youtu.be/k_LwlwJWZN0) in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile). One possible cause for the multiple tails is dust and gas being [expelled](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151118.html) from the comet's [rotating nucleus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960414.html). The outward push of the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/)'s complex [solar wind](https://science.nasa.gov/learn/heat/resource/solar-wind-across-our-solar-system-infographic/) may also play a role. The huge iceberg-like nucleus of [Comet](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/facts/) [ATLAS](https://atlas.fallingstar.com/) appears to have [broken up](https://skyandtelescope.org/uncategorized/comet-atlas-caught-in-the-act-of-disintegration/) near its closest approach to the Sun two weeks ago. Unfortunately, [Comet ATLAS](https://theskylive.com/c2024g3-info) and its tails are expected to fade significantly over the coming weeks.
