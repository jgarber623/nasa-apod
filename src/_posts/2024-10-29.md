The stars are destroying the pillars. More specifically, some of the newly formed [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/types/) in the image center are emitting light so energetic that is [evaporating](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231206.html) the gas and dust in the surrounding [pillars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201206.html). Simultaneously, the [pillar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230110.html)s themselves are still trying to [form new stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation). The whole setting is the star cluster [NGC 602](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_602), and this new vista was taken by the [Webb Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/) in multiple [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) colors. In comparison, a roll-over image shows the same star cluster in [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/), taken previously by the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/). NGC 602 is located near the perimeter of the [Small Magellanic Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Magellanic_Cloud) (SMC), a small satellite galaxy of our Milky Way galaxy. At the estimated distance of the SMC, the [featured picture](https://esawebb.org/images/weic2425c/) spans about 200 light-years. A [tantalizing](https://cdn.animalchannel.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/06062531/concerned_dog_featured-1.png) assortment of [background galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210802.html) are also visible -- mostly around the edges -- that are at least hundreds of millions of [light-year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/)s beyond.
