Does the Moon ever engulf Mars? Yes, but only in the sense that it moves in front, which happens on [rare occasions](https://earthsky.org/tonight/best-stargazing-of-2025-events-planets-moon-stars/). This happened just yesterday, though, as seen from some locations in [North America and western Africa](https://in-the-sky.org/news/occultations/occultation_20250114_0349_visibility.png). [This occultation](https://in-the-sky.org/news.php?id=20250114_16_100) was notable not only because the Moon was a fully lit [Wolf Moon](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/wolf.html), but because Mars was near its largest and brightest, moving to [opposition](https://spider.seds.org/spider/Mars/marsopps.html) -- the closest to the Earth in its orbit -- only tomorrow. The [engulfing](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=652639413632533), more formally called an [occultation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation), typically lasting about an hour. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DEzq_L4RiAa/) was taken from near [Chicago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6DtEAYgOsM), [Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois), [USA](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/) just as [Earth's largest satellite](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240724.html) was angularly moving away from the much more distant [red planet](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/). Our [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/) occasionally moves in front of all of the [Solar System](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/menu/solar-system/)'s planets. Given the temporary alignment of [orbital planes](https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/wp-content/uploads/sites/193/2020/10/Opposition_Conjunction.jpg), the [next time](https://astropixels.com/almanac/almanac21/almanac2025est.html) our [Moon eclipses Mars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030724.html) will be a relatively soon February 9.
