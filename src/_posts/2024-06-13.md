Big, beautiful [spiral galaxy Messier 66](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-66) lies a mere 35 million light-years away. The [gorgeous island universe](https://esahubble.org/images/heic1006a/) is about 100 thousand light-years across, similar in size to the Milky Way. This [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/hubble-celebrates-the-15th-anniversary-of-servicing-mission-4/) close-up view spans a region about 30,000 light-years wide around the galactic core. It shows the galaxy's disk dramatically inclined to our line-of-sight. Surrounding its bright core, the likely home of a supermassive black hole, obscuring dust lanes and young, blue star clusters sweep [along spiral arms](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230829.html) dotted with the tell-tale glow of pinkish star forming regions. Messier 66, also known as NGC 3627, is the brightest of the three galaxies in the gravitationally interacting [Leo Triplet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240321.html).
