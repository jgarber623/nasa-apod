When did you first learn to identify this group of stars? Although they are familiar to many people around the world, different cultures have associated this [asterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy)) with [different icons and folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper#Names_and_places). Known in the [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) as the [Big Dipper](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130421.html), the stars are part of a constellation designated by the [International Astronomical Union](https://www.iau.org/administration/about/) in 1922 as the Great Bear ([Ursa Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major)). The recognized star names of these stars are (left to right) [Alkaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Ursae_Majoris), [Mizar/Alcor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizar_and_Alcor), [Alioth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_Ursae_Majoris), [Megrez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Ursae_Majoris), [Phecda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_Ursae_Majoris), [Merak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Ursae_Majoris), and [Dubhe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Ursae_Majoris). Of course, stars in any given [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/en/) are unlikely to be physically [related](http://www.comfychair.org/~cmbell/myth/myth.html). But [surprisingly](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/96/d5/19/96d5193fa5f6968243838aef44d4b4b7.jpg), most of the Big Dipper stars do seem to be headed in the same direction as they [plough](http://www.dibonsmith.com/uma_con.htm) through space, a property they share with other stars spread out over an even larger area across the sky. [Their measured common motion](http://www.kencroswell.com/DescendantsOfTheDipper.html) suggests that they all belong to a loose, nearby [star cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap051118.html), thought to be on average only about 75 [light-years](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/faq/26/what-is-a-light-year/) away and up to 30 light-years across. The cluster is more properly known as the [Ursa Major Moving Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major_moving_group). The [featured image](https://www.facebook.com/cullenmedia/photos/a.1042986535821786.1073741827.1034682046652235/1446299962157106/?type=3&theater) captured the iconic stars recently above [Pyramid Mountain](https://youtu.be/hEyJPyemodA) in [Alberta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada).
