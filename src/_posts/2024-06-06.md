Magnificent spiral galaxy [NGC 4565](http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n4565.html) is viewed edge-on from planet Earth. Also known as the Needle Galaxy for its narrow profile, bright NGC 4565 is a stop on many telescopic tours of the northern sky, in the faint but well-groomed constellation [Coma Berenices](http://www.dibonsmith.com/com_con.htm). [This sharp, colorful image](https://fenyeslorand.hu/a-tu-galaxis/) reveals the galaxy's [boxy, bulging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10073) central core cut by [obscuring dust lanes](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/needle-edge.html) that lace NGC 4565's thin galactic plane. NGC 4565 itself lies about 40 million [light-years](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) distant and spans some 100,000 light-years. Easily spotted with small telescopes, [sky enthusiasts](http://www.cloudynights.com/item.php?item_id=1059) consider NGC 4565 to be a prominent celestial masterpiece [Messier missed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080419.html).
