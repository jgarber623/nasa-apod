Is this the largest hummingbird ever? Although it may look like a popular fluttering [nectarivore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectarivore), what is pictured is actually a beautifully detailed and colorful [aurora](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/), complete with rays reminiscent of feathers. This [aurora](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241223.html) was so bright that it was visible to the unaided eye during [blue hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_hour) -- just after sunset when the [sky appears](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210826.html) a darkening blue. However, the [aurora](https://www.aurorasaurus.org/) only looked like a [hummingbird](https://www.hummingbirdcentral.com/hummingbird-faqs.htm) through a sensitive camera able to pick up faint glows. As [reds](https://img.apmcdn.org/7a6d073179a68e50dbf9833adb72225a76554a51/uncropped/0011cd-20241011-nws-aurora-colors-webp1000.webp) typically occurring higher in the [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-earths-atmosphere/) than the greens, the real [3D](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230624.html) shape of this aurora would likely appear unfamiliar. [Auroras](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/auroras/) are created when an [explosion on the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240818.html) causes high energy particles to flow into the Earth's atmosphere and [excite](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/comments/hwt0yz/happy_kitty/#lightbox) atoms and molecules of nitrogen and oxygen. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DFhlId7M9TP/) was captured about two weeks ago above [Lyngseidt](https://youtu.be/gbkRxvcsQqQ), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway).
