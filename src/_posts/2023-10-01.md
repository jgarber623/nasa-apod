A good place to see a ring-of-fire eclipse, it seemed, would be from a desert. In a desert, there should be relatively few obscuring clouds and trees. Therefore late December of 2019, a group of photographers traveled to the [United Arab Emirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates) and [Rub al-Khali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rub%27_al_Khali), the largest continuous sand desert in world, to capture clear images of an [unusual eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191228.html) that would be passing over. A [ring-of-fire eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170301.html) is an annular eclipse that occurs when [the Moon](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/) is far enough away on its elliptical orbit around [the Earth](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/) so that it appears too small, angularly, to cover [the entire Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/). At the maximum of an [annular eclipse](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question6.html), the edges of the Sun can be seen all around the edges of the Moon, so that the Moon appears to be a dark spot that covers most -- but not all -- of the Sun. [This particular eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_December_26,_2019), they knew, would peak [soon after sunrise](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191227.html). After [seeking out](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2313450158759190&type=3) such a dry and barren place, it turned out that some of the most [interesting eclipse images](https://www.facebook.com/pg/APOD.Sky/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2313450158759190) actually included [a tree in the foreground](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181230.html), because, in addition to the [sand dune](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160119.html)s, the tree gave the surreal background a contrasting sense of normalcy, scale, and [texture](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170611.html). On Saturday, October 14, a new [ring of fire](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030605.html) will be visible through clear skies from a thin swath crossing both [North and South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas#/media/File:Americas_(orthographic_projection).svg).
