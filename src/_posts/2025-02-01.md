Vivid and lustrous, wafting iridescent waves of color wash across this skyscape from northern Sweden. [Known as nacreous clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_stratospheric_cloud) or mother-of-pearl clouds, they are rare. But their [unforgettable](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018BAMS...99.1377P/abstract) appearance was captured in this snapshot on January 12 with the Sun just below the local horizon. A type of [polar stratospheric cloud](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_680.html), they form when unusually cold temperatures in the usually cloudless lower stratosphere form ice crystals. Still sunlit at altitudes of around 15 to 25 kilometers, the clouds diffract the sunlight even when the Sun itself is hidden from direct view.
