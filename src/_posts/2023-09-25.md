What's happening to this spiral galaxy? Just a few hundred million years ago, NGC 2936, the upper of the two large [galaxies shown](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxHlYCyJKDR/) at the bottom, was likely a [normal spiral galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130416.html) -- spinning, creating stars -- and minding its own business. But then it got too close to the [massive elliptical galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120914.html) NGC 2937, just below, and took a turn. Sometimes dubbed the [Hummingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird#/media/File:Ruby-Throated_Hummingbird.png) Galaxy for its iconic shape, NGC 2936 is not only being deflected but also being distorted by the [close gravitational interaction](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211004.html). Behind filaments of dark [interstellar dust](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain), bright blue stars form the nose of the hummingbird, while the center of the spiral appears as an eye. Alternatively, the galaxy pair, together known as [Arp 142](https://esahubble.org/videos/heic1311a/), look to some like [Porpoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoise) or a [penguin](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:African_Penguin_with_egg_%2843841665775%29.jpg) protecting an egg. The [featured re-processed image](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxHlYCyJKDR/) showing [Arp 142](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AAS...22713511R/abstract) in great detail was taken recently by the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/about). Arp 142 lies about 300 million [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) away toward the constellation of the Water Snake ([Hydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(constellation))). In a billion years or so the [two galaxies will likely merge](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120604.html) into one larger galaxy.
