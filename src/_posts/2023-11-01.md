Part of the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) disappeared earlier this month, but few people were worried. The missing part, which included the center from some locations, just went behind the [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/) in what is known as an [annular solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2023/where-when). Featured here is an [eclipse sequence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190122.html) taken as the Moon was overtaking the rising Sun in the sky. The foreground hill is [Factory Butte](https://youtu.be/D0GxV5zpagQ) in [Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). The rays flaring out from the Sun are not real -- they result from camera [aperture diffraction](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010415.html) and are known as [sunstar](https://www.blueskytraveler.com/how-to-create-sunstars-in-your-photos/). The Moon is [real](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3d/3d/bc/3d3dbcf8a4f9dbee8fc608c8d62dbb8c.jpg), but it is artificially brightened to enhance its outline -- which helps the viewer better visualize the Moon's changing position during this [ring-of-fire eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230924.html). As stunning as this [eclipse sequence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231005.html) is, it was considered just practice by the astrophotographer. The reason? She hopes to use this experience to better photograph the [total solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/) that will occur over [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) on April 8, 2024.
