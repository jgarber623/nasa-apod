If you could fly over Mars, what might you see? The [featured image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/192271236@N03/53962162859/in/dateposted) shows exactly this in the form of a [Mars Express](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-express/) vista captured over a particularly interesting region on [Mars](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/facts/) in July. The picture's most famous feature is [Olympus Mons](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230404.html), the largest volcano in the [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/solar-system-facts/), visible on the upper right. Another large Martian volcano is visible on the right horizon: [Pavonis Mons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavonis_Mons). Several [circular impact craters](https://youtu.be/cNeRBuLAa7o?t=12) can be seen on the surface of the aptly named [red planet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970804.html). Impressively, this image was timed to capture the [dark](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230731.html) and [doomed](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220703.html) Martian moon [Phobos](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/moons/phobos/), visible just left of center. The [surface feature](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Map_of_Mars.png) on the lower left, known as [Orcus Patera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orcus_Patera), is unusual for its large size and oblong shape, and [mysterious](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express/Mars_s_mysterious_elongated_crater) because the processes that created it still remain unknown. [ESA](https://www.esa.int/)'s robotic [Mars Express](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express_overview) spacecraft was launched in 2003 and, among many [notable](https://marinhumane.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cat-on-computer.jpg) science [discoveries](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express/Mars_Express_science_highlights), bolstered evidence that Mars was once home to large [bodies of water](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050720.html).
