Galaxies are fascinating. In [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy), gravity alone holds together massive collections of stars, dust, interstellar gas, stellar remnants and dark matter. [Pictured](https://www.glitteringlights.com/Images/Galaxies/i-rXzDxS3/A) is NGC 5128, better known as Centaurus A. [Cen A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus_A) is the fifth brightest galaxy on the sky and is located at a distance of about 12 million light years from Earth. The warped shape of Cen A is the result of a [merger](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...645.1092Q/abstract) between an [elliptical](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040616.html) and a [spiral](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171226.html) galaxy. Its [active galactic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus) harbors a [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole) that is about [55 million](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/radio-particle-jets.html) times more massive than our Sun. This central black hole ejects a fast [jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet) visible in both [radio](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/05_radiowaves) and [X-ray](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays) light. Filaments of the jet are visible in red in the upper left. New [observations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01417-w) by the [Event Horizon Telescope](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/) have revealed a brightening of the jet only towards its edges -- but for reasons that are [currently unknown](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nM9qpNo6DzQ/maxresdefault.jpg) and an active topic of research.
