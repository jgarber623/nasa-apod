It's back. The famous active region on the Sun that created [auroras visible](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.431368006258449&type=3) around the Earth [earlier this month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2024_solar_storms) has survived its rotation around the far side of the Sun -- and returned. Yesterday, as it was beginning to reappear on the Earth-facing side, the region formerly labeled [AR 3664](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240511.html) threw another [major solar flare](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/x28-flare-old-region-3664), again in the highest-energy [X-class](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/10109/) range. The featured video shows the emerging [active region](https://science.nasa.gov/get-involved/citizen-science/be-a-solar-active-region-spotter/) on the lower left, as it was captured by NASA's Earth-orbiting [Solar Dynamics Observatory](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/) yesterday in [ultraviolet light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/). The video is a time-lapse of the entire [Sun rotating](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200819.html) over 24 hours. Watch the lower-left region carefully at about the 2-second mark to see the powerful [flare](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/space-weather/solar-flares/what-is-a-solar-flare/) burst out. The energetic particles from that flare and [associated CME](https://spaceweather.com/images2024/27may24/farsidecme.gif) are not expected to directly impact the Earth and trigger impressive auroras, but scientists will keep a [close watch](https://www.mediastorehouse.com/p/617/tabby-kitten-looking-pot-plant-9446207.jpg.webp) on this unusually [active region](https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&day=28&month=05&year=2024) over the next two weeks, as it faces the Earth, to see what develops.
