The colorful, spiky stars are in the foreground of this image taken with a small telescope [on planet Earth](https://daveandtelescope.wordpress.com/2025/01/08/a-rose-by-any-other-name/). They lie well within our own [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/). But the two eye-catching galaxies in the frame lie far beyond the Milky Way, at a distance of over 300 million light-years. The galaxies' twisted and distorted appearance is due to mutual gravitational tides as the pair engage in close encounters. Cataloged as Arp 273 (also as [UGC 1810](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201018.html)), these galaxies do look [peculiar](http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/frames.html), but interacting galaxies are now understood to be common in the universe. Closer to home, the large spiral Andromeda Galaxy is known to be some 2 million light-years away and [inexorably approaching](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/nasas-hubble-shows-milky-way-is-destined-for-head-on-collision/) the Milky Way. In fact the far away peculiar galaxies of Arp 273 may offer an analog of the [far future encounter](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2012/20/3028-Image.html) of Andromeda and Milky Way. Repeated galaxy encounters on a cosmic timescale ultimately result in a merger into a single galaxy of stars. [From our perspective](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/3872-Image), the bright cores of the Arp 273 galaxies are separated by only a little over 100,000 light-years.
