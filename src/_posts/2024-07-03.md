Big, bright, and beautiful, [spiral galaxy M83](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-83/) lies a mere twelve million light-years away, near the southeastern tip of the very long [constellation Hydra](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/hya/index.html). About 40,000 light-years across, M83 is known as the Southern Pinwheel for its pronounced spiral arms. But the wealth of [reddish star forming regions](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111111.html) found near the edges of the arms' thick dust lanes, also suggest another popular moniker for M83, the [Thousand-Ruby Galaxy](http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0825/). This new deep telescopic [digital image](https://pbase.com/strongmanmike2002/image/174678436) also records the bright galaxy's faint, extended halo. Arcing toward the bottom of the cosmic frame lies a [stellar tidal stream](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100911.html), debris drawn from massive M83 by the gravitational disruption of a smaller, merging satellite galaxy. Astronomers David Malin and Brian Hadley [found the elusive](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997PASA...14...52M) star stream in the mid 1990s by enhancing photographic plates.
