No one, presently, sees the Moon rotate like this. That's because the Earth's moon is tidally locked to the Earth, showing us [only one side](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33_tUHDkMY). Given [modern digital technology](https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/1200/https://media.snopes.com/2009/01/rand.jpg), however, combined with many detailed images returned by the [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://www.lroc.asu.edu/about) (LRO), a high resolution virtual [Moon rotation movie](https://www.lroc.asu.edu/images/707) has been composed. The [featured time-lapse video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNUNB6CMnE8) starts with the standard Earth [view of the Moon](http://www.google.com/moon/). Quickly, though, [Mare Orientale](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110312.html), a large crater with a dark center that is difficult to see from the Earth, rotates into view just below the equator. From an entire [lunar month](http://www.universetoday.com/19699/does-the-moon-rotate/) condensed into 24 seconds, the video clearly shows that the Earth side of [the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html) contains an abundance of [dark lunar maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_maria_on_the_Moon), while the lunar far side is dominated by bright [lunar highlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Moon#Highlands). Currently, over [32 new missions to the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_the_Moon#Funded_lunar_probe_missions_currently_under_development) are under active development from multiple countries and companies, including NASA's [Artemis program](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/) which aims to [land people on the Moon again](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-iii/) within the next few years.
