How did we get here? We know that we live on a [planet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html) orbiting a [star](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/) orbiting a [galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080606.html), but how did all of this form? Since our universe [moves too slowly](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0272/4770/6214/articles/do-cats-get-bored-800x533.jpg) to watch, faster-moving computer simulations are [created to help](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZjBEW+qNL.jpg) find out. Specifically, [this featured video](https://www.tng-project.org/media/) from the [Illustris](http://www.illustris-project.org/)[TNG](http://www.tng-project.org/) collaboration tracks gas from the early universe ([redshift](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130408.html) 12) until today ([redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift) 0). As the [simulation](https://www.tng-project.org/media/) begins, ambient gas falls into and accumulates in a region of relatively high [gravity](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/what-is-gravity/en/). After a few billion years, a well-defined center materializes from a strange and fascinating [cosmic dance](https://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=colliding+galaxy). Gas blobs -- some representing [small satellite galaxies](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/sattelit.html) -- continue to fall into and become absorbed by the rotating galaxy as the present epoch is reached and the video ends. For the [Milky Way Galaxy](http://cass.ucsd.edu/archive/public/tutorial/MW.html), however, big mergers may not be over -- recent evidence indicates that our large spiral disk Galaxy [will collide](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120604.html) and coalesce with the slightly larger [Andromeda spiral disk galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181217.html) in the next few billion years.
