Here is what the Earth looks like during a [solar eclipse](https://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html). The [shadow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201229.html) of the [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/) can be seen darkening part of [Earth](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg). This [shadow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031127.html) moved [across](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EYk_iSpBaE) the [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/earth.html) at nearly 2000 kilometers per hour. Only [observers](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2G61P84/curious-dog-funny-pug-looking-through-binoculars-up-in-the-sky-high-angle-owner-holding-a-tool-moon-reflecting-in-lenses-2G61P84.jpg) near the center of the [dark circle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031208.html) see a total solar eclipse - others see a partial eclipse where only part of the [Sun appears blocked by the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230516.html). This [spectacular picture](http://theastropages.com/articles/articles011.htm) of the 1999 August 11 [solar eclipse](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html) was one of the last ever taken from the [Mir space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir). The two bright spots that appear on the upper left are thought to be [Jupiter and Saturn](http://theastropages.com/articles/articles011.htm). Mir was [deorbited](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010323.html) in a [controlled re-entry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQd9Ejkbiw) in 2001. A [new solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/how-is-the-2024-total-solar-eclipse-different-than-the-2017-eclipse/) will occur over [North America](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/map/2024-april-8) in about two weeks.
