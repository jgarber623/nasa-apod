It seemed like night, but part of the sky glowed purple. It was the now famous night of May 10, 2024, when [people over much of the world reported beautiful aurora-filled skies](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.431368006258449&type=3). The featured image was captured this night during early morning hours from [Arlington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Wisconsin), [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). The panorama is a composite of several 6-second exposures covering two thirds of the visible sky, with [north](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240518.html) in the center, and processed to heighten the colors and remove electrical wires. The photographer (in the foreground) reported that the [aurora](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/en/) appeared to flow from a point overhead but illuminated the sky only toward the [north](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200212.html). The aurora's energetic particles originated from [CME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection)s [ejected](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/77/30/f7/7730f7bb82f011c58c53b31793ba3c51.jpg) from our Sun over sunspot [AR 6443](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240513.html) a few days before. This [large active region](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240511.html) rotated to the far side of the Sun last week, but [may well survive](https://science.nasa.gov/get-involved/citizen-science/be-a-solar-active-region-spotter/) to rotate back toward the [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220227.html) next week.
