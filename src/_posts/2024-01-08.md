Venus goes through [phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_Venus). Just like our Moon, [Venus](https://science.nasa.gov/venus/) can appear as a full circular disk, a thin [crescent](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230826.html), or anything in between. Venus, frequently the brightest object in the [post-sunset](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230102.html) or [pre-sunrise](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160130.html) sky, appears so small, however, that it usually requires binoculars or a small telescope to clearly see its current phase. The [featured time-lapse sequence](https://www.iau.org/public/images/detail/ann23043a/) was taken over the course of six months in 2015 from Surgères, [Charente-Maritime](https://youtu.be/nAlTvNII1O8), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), and shows not only how Venus changes phase, but changes angular size as well. When [Venus](https://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=Venus) is on the far side of the Sun from the Earth, it appears angularly smallest and nearest to full phase, while when [Venus and Earth](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/five-petals-of-venus/) are on the same side of the Sun, [Venus appears](https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/adorable-striped-cat-looking-up-cat-portrait-close-up_199743-10939.jpg) larger, but as a crescent. [This month Venus](https://earthsky.org/upl/2023/01/Venus-elongation-north-sunrise-2023-Guy-Ottewell.jpg) rises before dawn in [waxing](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-phases/) [gibbous](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231112.html) [phases](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-phases/).
