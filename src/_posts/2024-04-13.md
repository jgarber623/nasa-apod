Only those [along the narrow track](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/how-is-the-2024-total-solar-eclipse-different-than-the-2017-eclipse/) of the Moon's shadow on April 8 saw a total solar eclipse. But most of North America still saw a partial eclipse of the Sun. From Clearwater, Florida, USA this single snapshot captured multiple images of that more widely viewed celestial event without observing the Sun directly. [In the shade](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231015.html) of a palm tree, criss-crossing fronds are projecting recognizable eclipse images on the ground, [pinhole camera style](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/learn/project/how-to-make-a-pinhole-camera/). In Clearwater the maximum eclipse phase was about 53 percent.
