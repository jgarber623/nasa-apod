[A photograph of Buzz Aldrin](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/40th/images/apollo_image_12.html) standing on the Moon taken by [Neil Armstrong](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/about/biographies/pilots/neil-armstrong.html), was digitally reversed to create this lunar selfie. Captured in July 1969 following the Apollo 11 moon landing, [Armstrong's original photograph](https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-5903history.html) recorded not only the [magnificent desolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnificent_Desolation) of an [unfamiliar world](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070720.html), but Armstrong himself reflected in Aldrin's curved visor. In the [unwrapped image](https://petapixel.com/2021/07/26/unwrapping-buzz-aldrins-visor-in-moon-photo-reveals-what-he-saw/), the [spherical distortion](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/ooexmd/i_unwrapped_buzz_aldrins_visor_to_a_360_sphere_to/) of the reflection in Aldrin's helmet has been reversed. The transformed view features Armstrong himself [from Aldrin's perspective](https://youtu.be/TcjFRIWo0qw). Since Armstrong took the original picture, today the image [represents a fifty-four year](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/about/history/jsc50/as11-40-5875.html) old lunar selfie. Aldrin's visor reflection in the original image appears here on the left. Bright (but distorted) planet [Earth hangs in the lunar sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181224.html) above Armstrong's figure, toward the upper right. A foil-wrapped leg of the [Eagle lander](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1969-059C) and Aldrin's long shadow stretching across the lunar surface are prominently visible. In 2024 [NASA's Artemis II](https://www.nasa.gov/artemis-ii) mission will return humans to the Moon.
