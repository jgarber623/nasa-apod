[When the dark shadow of the Moon](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152663/total-solar-eclipse-darkens-north-america) raced across North America on April 8, [sky watchers](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190704.html) along the shadow's narrow central path were treated to a total solar eclipse. During the New Moon's shadow play diamonds glistened twice in the [eclipse-darkened skies](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152683/looking-up-and-down-during-the-eclipse). [The transient celestial jewels](http://www.alpo-astronomy.org/eclipse/observeeclipses/chapter9.htm) appeared immediately before and after the total eclipse phase. That's when the rays of a vanishing and then emerging sliver of solar disk are just visible behind the silhouetted Moon's edge, creating the appearance of a shiny diamond set in a dark ring. [This dramatic timelapse composite](https://www.instagram.com/wrightdobbs/p/C5i5kpHL1V4/) from north-central Arkansas captures both diamond ring moments of [this total solar eclipse](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.410844681644115&type=3). The diamond rings are separated by the ethereal beauty of [the solar corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240405.html) visible during totality.
