[Take this simulated plunge](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia22176-the-great-red-spot-plunge-animation) and dive into the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, the Solar System's ruling gas giant. [The awesome animation](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22176) is based on image data from JunoCam, and the microwave radiometer on board the Jupiter-orbiting [Juno](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno/) spacecraft. Your view will start about 3,000 kilometers above the southern Jovian cloud tops, and you can track your progress on the display at the left. As altitude decreases, temperature increases while you dive deeper at the location of Jupiter's famous [Great Red Spot](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140518.html). In fact, [Juno data indicates](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22177) the Great Red Spot, the Solar System's largest storm system, penetrates some 300 kilometers into the giant planet's atmosphere. For comparison, the [deepest point for planet Earth's oceans](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oceandepth.html) is just under 11 kilometers down. [Don't worry](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/29/b6/46/29b646bac35adcf4c4061c571fa352b9.jpg) though, you'll [fly back out again](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html).
