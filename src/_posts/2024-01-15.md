Sometimes, it's the stars that are the hardest to see that are the most interesting. [IC 348](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_348) is a young star cluster that illuminates surrounding filamentary dust. The stringy and winding dust appears pink in [this recently released infrared image](https://esawebb.org/images/weic2331a/) from the [Webb Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/). In [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/), this dust reflects mostly blue light, giving [the surrounding material](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230112.html) the familiar blue hue of a reflection nebula. Besides bright stars, several cool objects have been located in IC 348, visible because they glow brighter in [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/). These objects are hypothesized to be low mass [brown dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf). [Evidence for this](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024AJ....167...19L/abstract) includes the detection of an [unidentified](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/banner-three-pets-atttentive-thinking-600nw-2136132101.jpg) atmospheric chemical, likely a hydrocarbon, seen previously in the [atmosphere](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110119.html) of [Saturn](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/). These objects appear to have masses slightly greater than known planets, only a few times greater than [Jupiter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220828.html). Together, these indicate that this young [star cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230707.html) contains something noteworthy -- young planet-mass [brown dwarfs](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/what-makes-brown-dwarfs-unique) that float free, not orbiting any other star.
