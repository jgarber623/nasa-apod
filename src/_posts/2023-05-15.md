From afar, the whole thing looks like an [eagle](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/eagles-introduction/3089/). A closer look at the [Eagle Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Nebula), however, shows the [bright region](https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-02181/) is actually a window into the center of a larger dark shell of [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html). Through this window, a brightly-lit [workshop appears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvXIgpIuuxw) where a whole [open cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/open_clusters.html) of stars is being formed. In this cavity, [tall](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220925.html) [pillars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201206.html) and [round globules](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap081228.html) of dark dust and cold [molecular gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html) remain where stars are still forming. Already visible are several young [bright blue stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200909.html) whose light and winds are burning away and pushing back the [remaining filaments](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221020.html) and walls of gas and dust. The Eagle [emission nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/emission_nebulae.html), tagged M16, lies about 6500 [light years](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html) away, spans about 20 light-years, and is visible with [binoculars](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/binoculars.html) toward the [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/en/) of the Serpent ([Serpens](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/serpens.html)). [This picture](https://www.flickr.com/photos/194921065@N03/52874818977/in/pool-apods/) involved [long](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000560584900.jpg) and deep exposures and combined three specific emitted colors emitted by [sulfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur) (colored as yellow), [hydrogen](http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/1/hydrogen) (red), and [oxygen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPK_rSf1WUc) (blue).
