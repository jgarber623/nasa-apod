Sometimes the dark dust of interstellar space has an angular elegance. Such is the case toward the far-south [constellation of Chamaeleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamaeleon). Normally [too faint to see](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180628.html), dark dust is best known for blocking visible light from stars and galaxies behind it. In [this 36.6-hour exposure](https://www.astrobin.com/rlr0m9/), however, [the dust](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hiroc/47807534932) is seen mostly in light of its own, with its strong red and near-[infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) colors creating a brown hue. Contrastingly blue, the bright star [Beta Chamaeleontis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Chamaeleontis) is visible on the upper right, with the dust that surrounds it preferentially reflecting blue light from its primarily blue-white color. All of the pictured stars and dust occur in our own [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) with one [notable exception](https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/09/28/startled-cat-5.jpg): the white spot just [below Beta Chamaeleontis](http://www.werbeagentur.org/oldwexi/gallery.html) is the galaxy [IC 3104](https://theskylive.com/sky/deepsky/ic3104-object) which lies far in the distance. [Interstellar dust](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain) is mostly created in the cool atmospheres of [giant stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant) and dispersed into space by stellar light, [stellar winds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000318.html), and [stellar explosions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stellar_explosion_types) such as [supernovas](https://www.science.org/content/article/interstellar-dust-may-come-supernovae-after-all).
