What's happening around this star? No one is sure. [CW Leonis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_Leonis) is the closest [carbon star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_star), a star that appears orange because of atmospheric carbon dispersed from [interior nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon#Formation_in_stars). But [CW Leonis](https://youtu.be/KstINjrRovE) also appears engulfed in a gaseous carbon-rich nebula. What causes the nebula's [complexity is unknown](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EAS....71...87W/abstract), but its geometry of [shells](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221013.html) and arcs are surely [intriguing](https://www.intermountainpet.com/hubfs/Blog_Images/Dogs-tilting-their-heads.jpg). The [featured image](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2021/059/01FJW7YS4R5WJNFY1H3VTF56EZ) by the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/about) details this complexity. The low surface gravity of carbon [stars](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/sun-compare/) enhances their ability to expel [carbon](https://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml) and carbon compounds into space. Some of this carbon ends up forming [dark](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html) [dust](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain) that is commonly seen in the nebulas of [young star-forming regions](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230110.html) and the [disks of galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120311.html). Humans and all Earth-based [life are carbon-based](https://astrobiology.com/2016/09/where-did-carbon-come-from-for-life-on-earth.html), and at least some of [our carbon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230108.html) was likely once circulating in the atmospheres of near-death stars like [carbon stars](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-blogs/carbon-stars-will-make-see-red1203201401/).
