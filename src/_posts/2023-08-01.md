The monsters that live on the Sun are not like us. They are larger than the [Earth](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/) and made of gas hotter than in any [teapot](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211003.html). They have no eyes, but at times, [many tentacles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tentacle#/media/File:White_abalone_Haliotis_sorenseni.jpg). They [float](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220130.html). Usually, they slowly change shape and just [fade back onto the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180527.html) over about a month. Sometimes, though, they [suddenly explode](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190526.html) and [unleash energetic particles](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180902.html) into the Solar System that can attack the Earth.  Pictured is a [huge solar prominence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220302.html) imaged almost two weeks ago in the [light of hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-alpha). Captured by a small telescope in [Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert,_Arizona), [Arizona](https://youtu.be/sj13_HK_WUU), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), the [monster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101018.html)[esque](https://randomwordgenerator.com/fake-word.php) plume of gas was held aloft by the ever-present but [ever-changing magnetic field](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/understanding-the-magnetic-sun) near the surface of the Sun. Our [active Sun](https://spaceweather.com/images2023/02jul23/sunspotcounts.jpg) continues to show an [unusually high](https://cdn.animalchannel.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/06062531/concerned_dog_featured-1.png) number of [prominences](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220216.html), [filaments](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220913.html), [sunspots](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/solar-activity/en/), and [large active regions](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141022.html) as [solar maximum](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/sunspots_comparison_1.jpg) approaches in 2025.
