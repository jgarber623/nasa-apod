These people are not in danger. What is coming down from the left is just the Moon, far in the distance. [Luna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_(goddess)) appears so large here because she is being [photographed through a telescopic lens](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1806/Telescope_Teide.jpg). What is moving is mostly [the Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/), whose spin causes [the Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/) to slowly disappear behind [Mount Teide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teide), a volcano in the [Canary Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands) off the northwest coast of [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa). The people pictured are [16 kilometers away](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1806/teide_volcan_video.jpg) and many are facing the camera because they are watching [the Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/facts/) rise behind the photographer. It is not a [coincidence](https://atworkandbored.com/jokes-inc/fun-pics/long-neck-cat-8110.jpeg) that a [full moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211010.html) rises just when the [Sun sets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220320.html) because the Sun is always on the opposite side of the sky from a full moon. The [featured video](https://vimeo.com/272723959) was made in 2018 during the full [Milk Moon](https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2010/0526/What-is-a-milk-moon-anyway). The video is not [time-lapse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170820.html) -- this was really how fast [the Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160201.html) was setting.
