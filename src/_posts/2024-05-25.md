Orbiting 400 kilometers above Quebec, Canada, planet Earth, the International Space Station [Expedition 59 crew captured](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasa2explore/albums/72157684823968065/) this snapshot of the broad St. Lawrence River and curiously circular Lake Manicouagan on April 11. Right of center, the ring-shaped lake is a [modern reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manicouagan_Reservoir) within the eroded remnant of an ancient 100 kilometer diameter impact crater. The ancient crater is very [conspicuous from orbit](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180529.html), a visible reminder that Earth is vulnerable to [rocks from space](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130812.html). Over 200 million years old, the Manicouagan crater was likely caused by the impact of a rocky body about 5 kilometers in diameter. _Currently, there is no known asteroid with a significant probability of impacting Earth in the next century._ Each month, [NASAâ€™s Planetary Defense](https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-defense-news/) Coordination Office [releases an update](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/planetary-science/planetary-defense/near-earth-asteroids/) featuring the most recent figures on near-Earth object close approaches, and other facts about comets and asteroids that could pose a potential impact hazard with Earth.
