In digital [brush strokes, Jupiter's](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing?id=4140) signature atmospheric bands and vortices were used to form this interplanetary [post-impressionist](https://www.google.com/search?bih=872&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=Post-Impressionism&oq=Post-Impressionism) work of art. [The creative image](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/pia21983/abstract-jupiter-atmosphere) from [citizen scientist](https://science.nasa.gov/citizen-science/) Rick Lundh uses data from the Juno spacecraft's JunoCam. To paint on the digital canvas, a JunoCam image with contrasting light and dark tones was chosen for processing and an oil-painting software filter applied. The image data was captured during [perijove](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181214.html) 10. That was Juno's December 16, 2017 close encounter with the solar system's ruling gas giant. At the time the spacecraft was cruising about 13,000 kilometers above [northern Jovian cloud tops](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170804.html). Now in an extended mission, [Juno has explored](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/juno/) Jupiter and its moons since entering orbit around Jupiter in July of 2016.
