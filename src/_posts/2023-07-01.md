This tantalizing trio of galaxies sometimes called the Draco Group, is located in the northern constellation of (you guessed it) [Draco, the Dragon](http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/dra/index.html). From left to right are [face-on](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040410.html) spiral NGC 5985, [elliptical](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060520.html) galaxy NGC 5982, and [edge-on](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010510.html) spiral NGC 5981, all found within this single telescopic field of view that spans a little more than the width of the full moon. While the group is far too small to be a [galaxy cluster](http://www.seds.org/messier/gal_clus.html), and has not been [catalogued](http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/hickson/hcg/) as a compact galaxy group, the three galaxies all do lie roughly 100 million light-years from planet Earth. Not as well known as other tight [groupings of galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220718.html), the contrast in visual appearance still makes this triplet an attractive subject for astroimagers. On close examination with [spectrographs](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/how_l1/spectral.html), the bright core of striking spiral NGC 5985 shows prominent emission in specific wavelengths of light, prompting astronomers to classify it as a [Seyfert](http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/ScholarX/seyferts.html), a type of active galaxy. This [impressively deep exposure](https://www.astrobin.com/os11uz/D/) hints at a faint dim halo along with sharp-edged shells surrounding elliptical NGC 5982, evidence of past galactic mergers. It also reveals many even more [distant background galaxies](https://universe.nasa.gov/galaxies/basics/).
