Can the Moon and a mountain really cast similar shadows? Yes, but the division between light and dark does not have to be aligned. Pictured, a [quarter moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap041021.html) was captured above the [mountain Grivola](https://youtu.be/Boz-IyFv1oQ?t=530) in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) in early October of 2022. The [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) is to the right of the [featured picturesque landscape](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/undefined), illuminating the right side of the [Moon](https://science.nasa.gov/moon/) in a similar way that it illuminates the right side of the mountain. This [lunar phase](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-phases/) is called "[quarter](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231021.html)" because the [lit fraction visible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase) from [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html) is one quarter of the entire lunar surface. Digital post-processing of this single exposure gave both [gigantic](https://get.pxhere.com/photo/pet-kitten-cat-mammal-close-up-nose-whiskers-vertebrate-maine-coon-cat-cat-cat-norwegian-forest-cat-european-shorthair-burmilla-small-to-medium-sized-cats-cat-like-mammal-carnivoran-domestic-short-haired-cat-domestic-long-haired-cat-british-semi-longhair-turkish-angora-997523.jpg) objects more prominence. Capturing the [terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(solar)) of this quarter moon in [close alignment](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200507.html) with nearly vertical mountain ridge required careful timing because the [Earth rotates](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200701.html) once a day.
