Meteors have been flowing out from the [constellation Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_\(constellation\)). This was expected, as mid-December is the time of the [Geminid Meteor Shower](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/geminids/). Pictured here, over two dozen meteors were caught in [successively added](https://static8.depositphotos.com/1479497/941/i/380/depositphotos_9415227-stock-photo-cat-near-calculator.jpg) exposures taken over several hours early Saturday morning from a [snowy forest](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210206.html) in [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland). The [fleeting streaks](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240826.html) were bright enough to be seen over the din of the [nearly full Moon](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-phases/) on the upper right. These streaks can all be traced back to a point on the sky called the [radiant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_\(meteor_shower\)) toward the bright stars [Pollux and Castor](https://globeatnight.org/constellation/gemini/) in the image center. The [Geminid meteors](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191213.html) started as sand sized bits expelled from asteroid [3200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3200_Phaethon) [Phaethon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241212.html) during its elliptical orbit through the [inner Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/focus-areas/inner-solar-system/).
