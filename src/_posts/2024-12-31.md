What do you think this is? Hereâ€™s a clue: it's bigger than a bread box. [Much bigger](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fbp1czz6s0tx51.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D3619b12d7db6dbc232addfd27eabeb9c866de019). The answer is that pictured [NGC 4753](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_4753) is a [twisted disk galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241218.html), where unusual [dark dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241126.html) filaments provide clues about its history. No one is sure what happened, but a [leading model](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992AJ....104.1339S/abstract) holds that a relatively normal disk galaxy gravitationally ripped apart a dusty [satellite galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_galaxy) while its [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession) distorted the plane of the [accreted debris](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240616.html) as it rotated. The [cosmic collision](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) is [hypothesized](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992AJ....104.1339S/abstract) to have started about a billion years ago. [NGC 4753](https://noirlab.edu/public/news/noirlab2403/) is seen from the side, and possibly would look like a normal spiral galaxy from the top. The bright orange [halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_halo) is composed of many older stars that might trace [dark matter](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/overview/building-blocks/#dark-matter). The featured [Hubble image](https://esahubble.org/images/potw2420a/) was recently reprocessed to highlight [ultraviolet](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves/) and red-light emissions.
