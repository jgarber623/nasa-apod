To some, they look like battlements, here protecting us against the center of the [Milky Way](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/). The Three [Merlon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlon)s, also called the [Three Peaks of Lavaredo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tre_Cime_di_Lavaredo), stand tall today because they are made of dense dolomite rock which has better resisted [erosion](https://youtu.be/-43_HBy9huc) than surrounding softer rock. They formed about [250 million years ago](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/timeline-of-a-mass-extinction/) and so are comparable in age with one of the [great extinctions](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/the-great-dying/) of life on [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240324.html). A leading hypothesis is that this great [extinction](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/could-recent-supernovae-be-responsible-for-mass-extinctions/) was triggered by an [asteroid](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/) about 10-km across, larger in size than [Mount Everest](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110417.html), impacting the Earth. [Humans](https://www.nasa.gov/history/the-human-desire-for-exploration-leads-to-discovery/) have gazed up at the stars in the [Milky Way](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170726.html) and beyond for centuries, making these battlefield-like formations, based in the [Sexten Dolomites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexten_Dolomites), a popular place for [current](https://skywiseunlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/scoper_05.jpg) and [ancient astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_astronomy).
