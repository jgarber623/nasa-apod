[Comet C/2023 E1 (ATLAS)](https://theskylive.com/c2023e1-info) was just spotted in March, another comet found by the NASA funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. On July 1 this Comet ATLAS reached perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun. Days later the telescopic comet was [captured in this frame](https://www.astrobin.com/03ejcp/B/) sporting a pretty greenish coma and faint, narrow ion tail against a background of stars in the far northern constellation Ursa Minor. This comet's closest approach to Earth is still to come though. On August 18 this [visitor to the inner Solar System](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/overview/) will be a mere 3 light-minutes or so from our fair planet. [Based on its](https://minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=C/2023+E1) inclination to the ecliptic plane [and orbital](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=C%2F2023%20E1) period of about 85 years C/2023 E1 (ATLAS) is [considered](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...563A.122W/abstract) a [Halley-type comet](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/h/halley-type+comets).
