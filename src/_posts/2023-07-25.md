What do the famous [Eagle Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221004.html) star pillars look like in X-ray light? To find out, NASA's orbiting [Chandra X-ray Observatory](https://chandra.harvard.edu/) peered in and through these interstellar mountains of star formation. It was found that in [M16](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221206.html) the [dust pillars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201206.html) themselves do not emit many [X-rays](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays), but a lot of small-but-bright X-ray sources became evident. These sources are shown as bright dots on the [featured image](https://chandra.si.edu/photo/2023/chandrawebb2/more.html) which is a composite of exposures from [Chandra](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/main/index.html) ([X-rays](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays)), [XMM](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton) (X-rays), [JWST](https://webb.nasa.gov/) ([infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves)), [Spitzer](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/main/index.html) (infrared), [Hubble](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html) ([visible](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight)), and the [VLT](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/) (visible). What [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve) produce these X-rays remains a [topic of research](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...654..347L/abstract), but some are [hypothesized to be](https://i.insider.com/55a67a7a371d22ce178b6624?width=1200&format=jpeg) hot, [recently-formed, low-mass stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_stellar_object), while others are thought to be hot, older, high-mass stars. These [X-ray hot stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010920.html) are scattered around the frame -- the [previously identified](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061022.html) [Evaporating Gaseous Globules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporating_gaseous_globule) (EGGS) seen in [visible light](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080915.html) are not currently hot enough to emit X-rays.
