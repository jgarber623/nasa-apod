[As Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_in_fiction) wanders through Earth's night, it passes about 5 degrees south of the Pleiades star cluster in this composite astrophoto. The skyview was constructed from a series of images captured over a run of 16 consecutive clear nights beginning on July 12. [Mars' march](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/resources/resource-packages/mars-resources/) across the field of view begins at the far right, the planet's ruddy hue. showing a nice contrast with the blue Pleiades stars. Moving much faster across the sky against the distant stars, the fourth planet [from the Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/planets/) easily passes seventh planet Uranus, also moving across this field of view. Red planet Mars and the ice giant world were in close conjunction, about 1/2 degree apart, on July 16. Continuing its rapid eastward trek, Mars has now left the sister stars and outer planet behind though, [passing north](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221230.html) of red giant star Aldebaran. Mars will come within about 1/3 degree of Jupiter in [planet Earth's sky](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/whats-up-august-2024-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/) on August 14.
