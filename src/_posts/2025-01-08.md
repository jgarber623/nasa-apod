What happens after a star explodes? A [huge fireball](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171016.html) of hot gas shoots out in all directions. When this gas slams into the existing [interstellar medium](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190605.html), it heats up so much it glows. Two different [supernova remnant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_remnant)s (SNRs) are visible in the featured image, taken at the [Oukaïmeden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouka%C3%AFmeden_Observatory) [Observatory](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1ZeMqQz-U5o) in [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco). The [blue soccer ball](https://storage.googleapis.com/pod_public/1300/174757.jpg)\-looking nebula toward the upper left is [SNR G179.0+02.6](https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/915305-snr-g179026-a-buckyball-in-auriga/), which appears to be the smaller one. [This supernova](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/478/2/1987/4983130), about 11,000 light years distant, detonated about 50,000 years ago. Although composed mostly of [hydrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml) gas, the blue light is emitted by a trace amount of [oxygen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml). The seemingly larger SNR, dominating the lower right of the frame, is the Spaghetti Nebula, cataloged as [Simeis 147](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240227.html) and sh2-240. This supernova, only about 3,000 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) away, exploded about 40,000 years ago. Comparatively, even though they [appear different sizes](https://www.blueridgehumane.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cats-3971069_1280-1030x773.jpg), both supernova remnants are not only roughly the same age, but about the same size, too.
