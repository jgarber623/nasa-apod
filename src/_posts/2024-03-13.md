A broad expanse of glowing gas and dust presents a bird-like visage to astronomers [from planet Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090411.html), suggesting its popular moniker: the [Seagull Nebula](https://www.nebulaphotos.com/ngc-ic/ic2177/). [This portrait](https://www.flickr.com/photos/194921065@N03/) of the [cosmic bird](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230620.html) covers a 1.6-degree wide swath across the plane of the Milky Way, [near the direction](http://www.eanet.com/kodama/astro/2007/0216a/index.htm) of [Sirius](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161215.html), the alpha star of the constellation of the Big Dog ([Canis Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major)). Of course, [the region](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLW7uPs7hS0) includes objects with other catalog designations: notably [NGC 2327](https://theskylive.com/sky/deepsky/ngc2327-object), a compact, dusty emission and reflection nebula with an embedded massive star that forms the [bird's head](https://petcube.com/blog/content/images/2021/03/IMG_1796--1-.png). Dominated by the [reddish glow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-alpha) of atomic [hydrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml), the complex of gas and dust clouds with bright young stars spans over 100 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) at an estimated 3,800 [light-year](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) distance.
