With spacecraft thrusters at top center, the rugged surface of the Moon lies below the [Blue Ghost](https://fireflyspace.com/blue-ghost/) lander in this space age [video](https://www.youtube.com/@FireflySpace/videos) frame. The view of the lunar far side was captured by the Firefly Aerospace lunar lander on February 24, following a maneuver to circularize its orbit about 100 kilometers above the lunar surface. The robotic lunar lander is [scheduled to](https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/) touch down [tomorrow, Sunday, March 2](https://www.youtube.com/@FireflySpace/streams), at 3:34am Eastern Time in the [Mare Crisium impact basin](https://www.lroc.asu.edu/images/1400) on the lunar near side. In support of the [Artemis campaign](https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/artemis/), Blue Ghost is set to deliver science and technology experiments to the Moon, part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. [Blue Ghost's mission](https://fireflyspace.com/news/blue-ghost-mission-1-live-updates/) on the surface is planned to operate during the lunar daylight hours at the landing site, about 14 Earth days.
