Why isn't spiral galaxy [M66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_66) symmetric? Usually, [density waves](https://youtu.be/c5Us-jonCLA) of gas, dust, and newly formed stars circle a [spiral galaxy](http://www.seds.org/messier/spir.html)'s center and create a [nearly symmetric galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210312.html). The differences between M66's spiral arms and the apparent displacement of its [nucleus](https://www.glyphweb.com/esky/concepts/galacticnucleus.html) are all likely caused by previous close interactions and the [tidal gravitational pulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force) of nearby galaxy neighbors [M65 and NGC 3628](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210320.html). The galaxy, [featured here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/brian_tomlinson/52631087860/in/pool-apods/) in [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) taken by the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://webb.nasa.gov/content/about/index.html), spans about 100,000 [light years](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html), lies about 35 million [light years](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question19.html) distant, and is the largest galaxy in a group known as the [Leo Triplet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Triplet). Like many spiral galaxies, the long and intricate [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html) lanes of [M66](https://esahubble.org/videos/heic1006a/) are seen intertwined with the [bright stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars) and [intergalactic dust](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain) that follow the spiral arms.
