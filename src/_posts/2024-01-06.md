You couldn't really be caught in this blizzard while standing by a cliff on periodic comet [67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/67p-churyumov-gerasimenko/in-depth/). Orbiting the comet in June of 2016, the [Rosetta](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Rosetta) spacecraft's narrow angle camera did record streaks of dust and ice particles similar to snow as they drifted across the field of view close to the camera and [above](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170331.html) the comet's surface. Still, some of the [bright specks](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2167224-amazing-gif-shows-dust-and-cosmic-rays-raining-down-on-comet-67p/) in the scene are likely due to a rain of energetic charged particles or [cosmic rays](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/goddard/2016/ace-cosmic-ray) hitting the camera, and the dense background of stars in the direction of the constellation of the Big Dog ([Canis Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Major)). [In the video](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1804/RosettaOsirisC67P_JacintRoger.gif), the background stars are easy to spot trailing from top to bottom. The stunning movie was constructed from 33 [consecutive images](https://imagearchives.esac.esa.int/index.php?/category/410/start-72#top) taken over 25 minutes while Rosetta cruised some 13 kilometers from [the comet's nucleus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200127.html). In September 2016, the nucleus became the final resting place for the Rosetta spacecraft after its mission was ended with a successful controlled impact on [67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap211113.html).
