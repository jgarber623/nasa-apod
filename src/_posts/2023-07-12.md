Why do some spiral galaxies have a ring around the center? Spiral galaxy [NGC 1398](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1398) not only has a [ring](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170710.html) of pearly stars, gas and [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html) around its center, but a [bar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221016.html) of stars and gas _across_ its center, and spiral arms that appear like ribbons farther out. The [featured deep image](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtCsJ19N5tb/) from [Observatorio El Sauce](https://youtu.be/S4rFdr2Qmjk) in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile) shows the [grand spiral](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171226.html) galaxy in impressive detail. [NGC 1398](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...447..159M/abstract) lies about 65 million [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) distant, meaning the light we see today left this galaxy when [dinosaurs were disappearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event) from the [Earth](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/). The [photogenic](https://i.etsystatic.com/18172150/r/il/097703/4787375357/il_794xN.4787375357_7476.jpg) galaxy is visible with a small telescope toward the constellation of the Furnace ([Fornax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornax)). The [ring near the center](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170807.html) is likely an expanding [density wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_wave_theory) of star formation, caused either by a [gravitational encounter with another galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130514.html), or by the galaxy's own [gravitational asymmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_galaxy#Bar_instability).
