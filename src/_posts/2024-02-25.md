All of the other aurora watchers had gone home. By 3:30 am in [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland), on a quiet September night, much of that night's auroras had died down. Suddenly, unexpectedly, a new burst of particles streamed down from space, lighting up the [Earth's atmosphere](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html) once again. This time, surprisingly, [pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia)cally, the night lit up with an [amazing](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140429.html) [shape](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121003.html) reminiscent of a giant [phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology)). With camera equipment at the ready, two quick sky images were taken, followed immediately by a third of the land. The mountain in the background is [Helgafell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BuhpUn0LsE), while the small foreground river is called Kaldá, both located about 30 kilometers north of Iceland's capital [Reykjavík](https://youtu.be/-5exa7svE5Y). [Seasoned skywatchers](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7071/7180595308_f6ba60d0b8_b.jpg) will note that just above the mountain, toward the left, is the [constellation of Orion](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101117.html), while the [Pleiades](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140225.html) [star cluster](http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=18009) is also visible just above the frame center. The 2016 [aurora](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/), which lasted only a minute and was soon gone forever -- would possibly be dismissed as a [fanciful fable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_tale) -- were it not captured in the [featured, digitally-composed, image mosaic](https://www.facebook.com/Icelandic.Photos/photos/pb.1859684057503918.-2207520000.1458064624./2130278890444432/).
