What if a rocket could return to its launch tower -- and be caught? This happened for the first time 10 days ago, after a [SpaceX Starship](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/) rocket blasted off from its pad in [Boca Chica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Chica_\(Texas\)), [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). Starship then [split](https://chert-poberi.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/proga/222/sasha-19october1619394239.jpg), as planned, with its upper stage landing in the [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean). The big difference was the lower stage, [Super Heavy Booster 12](https://starship-spacex.fandom.com/wiki/Booster_12_\(B12\)), was caught by its launch tower about [7 minutes later](https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1845442658397049011). Catching a rocket for reuse is a new and innovative way to help reduce the cost of [rocket flight](https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/spacex-launches-fifth-starship-test-eyes-novel-booster-catch-2024-10-13/) by making rockets more easily reusable. [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship) rockets may be used by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) in the future to send spacecraft to [Earth orbit](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/orbits/), the [Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190717.html), and even [other planet](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/)s.
