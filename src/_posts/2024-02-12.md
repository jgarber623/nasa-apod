[Planetary nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula) like [Heckathorn-Fesen-Gull 1](https://www.sternwarte-baerenstein.de/hfg1-abell6-en.html) (HFG1) and [Abell 6](https://in-the-sky.org/data/object.php?id=Abell_6) in the constellation [Cassiopeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation)) are remnants from the last phase of a [medium sized star](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/educators/lifecycles/SC_main_p1.html) like our [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun). In spite of their shapes, planetary nebulae have [nothing in common with actual planets](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5b631cba5b409b413bb3a633/1533669968141-15YL8HF098WAOR8RYKFD/A-dog-looking-confused-and-surprised.jpg). Located in the bottom left part of the [featured photo](https://www.facebook.com/ZwoDesignAstronomyCameras/posts/802324015256448), HFG1 was created by the [binary star system](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/multiple-star-systems/) V664 Cas, which consists of a [white dwarf star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231224.html) and a [red giant star](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110408.html). Both stars orbit their [center of mass](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/barycenter/en/) over about [half an Earth day](https://www.astro.oma.be/en/gaia-observes-a-cosmic-clock-inside-a-large-planetary-nebula/). Traveling with the entire nebula at a speed about 300 times faster than the fastest train on Earth, V664 Cas generates a [bluish](https://www.astronomersdoitinthedark.com/index.php?c=145&p=571) arc shaped [shock wave](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240104.html). The wave interacts most strongly with the surrounding [interstellar medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium) in the areas where the arc is brightest. After roughly [10,000 years](http://koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO200502637762045.page), planetary nebulae become invisible due to a lack of [ultraviolet light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) being emitted by the [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star)s that create them. Displaying [beautiful shapes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240107.html) and structures, planetary nebulae are [highly desired object](https://skynews.ca/hfg1-abell-6-by-dan-kusz/)s for astrophotographers.
