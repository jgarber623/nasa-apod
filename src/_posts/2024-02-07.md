Are these two galaxies really attracted to each other? Yes, [gravitationally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity), and the result appears as an [enormous](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220214.html) [iconic heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_symbol) -- at least for now. [Pictured](https://www.kentbiggs.com/images/galaxies/N4038.htm) is the pair of galaxies cataloged as [NGC 4038](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180523.html) and NGC 4039,known as the [Antennae Galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220331.html). Because they are only 60 million [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) away, close by [intergalactic standards](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130408.html), the pair is one of the best studied [interacting galaxies](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191120.html) on the night sky. Their [strong attraction](https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/travelling-cuddling-stray-cats-istanbul-orin-fb12-png__700.jpg) began about a billion years ago when they passed unusually close to each other. As the two [galaxies](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/galaxies/) interact, their [stars](https://esahubble.org/wordbank/star/) rarely collide, but new stars are formed when their interstellar gases crash together. Some new stars have already formed, for example, in the [long antennae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(biology)#/media/File:Rosalia_alpina_side.JPG) seen extending out from the sides of the dancing duo. By the time the [galaxy merger](http://astronomyonline.org/Cosmology/GalaxyMergers.asp) is complete, likely over a [billion years from now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future), billions of new stars may have formed.
