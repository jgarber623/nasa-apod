Magnificent island universe [NGC 2403 stands](http://messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n2403.html) within the boundaries of the long-necked constellation [Camelopardalis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelopardalis). Some 10 million light-years distant and about 50,000 light-years across, the spiral galaxy also seems to have more than its fair share of giant star forming [HII regions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_II_region), marked by the telltale reddish glow of atomic hydrogen gas. The giant HII regions are energized by clusters of hot, massive stars that explode as [bright supernovae](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2004/news-2004-23.html) at the end of their short and furious lives. A member of the M81 group of galaxies, NGC 2403 closely resembles a galaxy in our own local galaxy group with an abundance of star forming regions, M33, the [Triangulum Galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131226.html). [Spiky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121013.html) in appearance, bright stars in [this portrait of NGC 2403](http://www.astrobin.com/2ve5vn/) are in the foreground, within our own Milky Way. Also in the foreground of the deep, wide-field, telescopic image are the Milky Way's dim and dusty interstellar clouds also known as [galactic cirrus](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230721.html) or integrated flux nebulae. But faint features that seem to extend from [NGC 2403 itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13526) are likely tidal stellar streams drawn out by gravitational interactions with neighboring galaxies.
