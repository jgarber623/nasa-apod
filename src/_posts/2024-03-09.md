As spring approaches for northern skygazers [Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12P/Pons%E2%80%93Brooks) is growing brighter. [Currently visible](https://starwalk.space/en/news/pons-brooks-comet-2024) with small telescopes and binoculars the Halley-type comet could reach naked eye visibility in the coming weeks. Seen despite a foggy atmosphere, the comet's green coma and long tail hover near the horizon, in this well-composed [deep night skyscape](https://www.petrhoralek.com/?p=23932) from Revuca, Slovakia recorded on March 5. In the sky above the Halley-type comet, the Andromeda (right) and Triangulum galaxies [flank bright star Mirach](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150926.html), beta star of the constellation Andromeda. The two spiral galaxies are members of our local galaxy group and over 2.5 million light-years distant. Comet Pons-Brooks is a periodic [visitor to the inner Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/) and less than 14 light-minutes away. Reaching its perihelion on April 21, this comet should be visible in the sky [during the April 8 total solar eclipse.](https://earthsky.org/tonight/12-p-comet-pons-brooks-outburst-millennium-falcon-bright-2024-eclipse/)
