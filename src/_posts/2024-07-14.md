The galaxy was never in danger. For one thing, the [Triangulum galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180927.html) (M33), pictured, is much bigger than the [tiny grain of rock](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011117.html) at the head of the meteor. For another, the galaxy is much farther away -- in this instance 3 million [light year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/)s as opposed to only about 0.0003 light seconds. Even so, the [meteor's path](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130209.html) took it angularly below the galaxy. Also the wind high in [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-earths-atmosphere/) blew the [meteor's glowing evaporative molecule train](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/catching-meteor-train) away from the galaxy, in [angular projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_perspective#/media/File:Europe_2007_Disk_1_340.jpg). Still, the astrophotographer was quite lucky to capture [both a meteor and a galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180812.html) in a single exposure -- which was subsequently added to two other images of [M33](https://youtu.be/qVTgWPFRQCo) to bring up the [spiral galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy)'s colors. At the end, [the meteor](https://www.amsmeteors.org/meteor-showers/meteor-faq/) was gone in a second, but [the galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulum_Galaxy) will last billions of years.
