A mere seven hundred light years from Earth toward the constellation [Aquarius](http://hawastsoc.org/deepsky/aqr/index.html), a star is dying. The once sun-like star's last few thousand years have produced the [Helix Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix_Nebula). Also known as NGC 7293, the cosmic Helix is a well studied and nearby example of a [Planetary Nebula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula), typical of this final phase of stellar evolution. Combining narrow band data from emission lines of hydrogen atoms in red and oxygen atoms in blue-green hues, this deep image shows tantalizing [details](https://stsci-opo.org/STScI-01EVT8HWJ754VADGE57NY9VWXP.jpg) of the Helix, including its bright [inner region](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030510.html) about 3 light-years across. The white dot at the Helix's center is this Planetary Nebula's hot, dying [central star](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2003/11/1317-Image.html). A simple looking nebula at first glance, the Helix is now understood to have a surprisingly [complex geometry](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2004/news-2004-32.html).
