What's happening in the night sky? To help find out, telescopes all over the globe will be [pointing](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170221.html) into deep space. [Investigations](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Cat_investigates_washing_machine_2003-07-03.png) will include trying to understand the [early universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230715.html), finding and tracking [Earth-menacing asteroids](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/about/neo_groups.html), searching for [planets that might contain extra-terrestrial life](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/), and [monitoring stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200217.html) to help better understand our Sun. The [featured composite](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs_zV9fIztu/) includes foreground and background images taken in April from a mountaintop on [La Palma](https://youtu.be/Ub9622tvuUM) island in the [Canary Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands) of [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain). Pictured, several telescopes from the [Roque de los Muchachos Observatory](https://youtu.be/ADH89JORFY4) are shown in front of a dark night sky. Telescopes in the foreground include, left to right, [Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAGIC_(telescope)) 1, [Galileo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_National_Telescope), [Magic](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200724.html) 2, [Gran Canarian](http://www.gtc.iac.es/gtc/gtc.php), and [LST](https://www.lst1.iac.es/). Sky highlights in the background include the [central band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230620.html) of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/), the constellations of [Sagittarius](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/sagittarius.html), [Ophiuchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiuchus) and [Scorpius](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210616.html), the red-glowing [Eagle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220812.html) and [Lagoon Nebulas](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-8-the-lagoon-nebula), and the stars [Alrami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Sagittarii) and [Antares](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220126.html). Due to [observatories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory) like this, [humanity](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190818.html) has understood more about our [night sky](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/home/) in the past 100 years than ever before in all of [human history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history#/media/File:World-population-1750-2015-and-un-projection-until-2100.png).
