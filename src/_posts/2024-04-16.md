The explosion is over, but the consequences continue. About eleven thousand years ago, a star in the constellation of [Vela](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190110.html) could be seen to [explode](https://youtu.be/wymMn-SmALY), creating a strange point of light briefly visible to humans living near the beginning of [recorded history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting). The outer layers of the star crashed into the [interstellar medium](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130924.html), driving a [shock wave](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210414.html) that is still visible today. The [featured image](https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noirlab2406a/) captures some of that filamentary and gigantic shock in [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/). As gas flies away from the detonated star, it [decays](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/observatories/satellite/compton/snr.html) and reacts with the interstellar medium, producing light in many different colors and energy bands. Remaining at the center of the [Vela Supernova Remnant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_Supernova_Remnant) is a [pulsar](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/neutron_stars1.html), a star as dense as nuclear matter that [spins around](https://youtu.be/jv2rEa7iqhA) more than ten times in a single second.
