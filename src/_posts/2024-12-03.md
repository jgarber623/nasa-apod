If you could stand on Mars -- what might you see? You might look out over a [vast orange landscape](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180404.html) covered with rocks under a dusty orange sky, with a blue-tinted [Sun setting](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200802.html) over the horizon, and odd-shaped water clouds hovering high overhead. This was just [the view](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1108810870821013) captured last March by NASA's rolling explorer, [Perseverance](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/). The [orange coloring](https://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/69-Why-is-Mars-reddish) is caused by [rusted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust) iron in the Martian dirt, some of which is small enough to be [swept up by winds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231107.html) into the atmosphere. The blue tint near the setting Sun is caused by [blue light](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/) being preferentially scattered out from the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) by the floating dust. The light-colored clouds on the right are likely composed of [water-ice](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/mars-water-ice-clouds-are-key-to-odd-thermal-rhythm/) and appear high in the [Martian atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mars). The shapes of some of these clouds are [unusual](https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/scared-surprised-cat-face.jpg) for Earth and remain a topic of research.
