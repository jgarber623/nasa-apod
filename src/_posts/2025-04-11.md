Made with a telescope shaded from bright sunlight by an umbrella, on April 5 a [well-planned video](https://www.instagram.com/aj.smadi/p/DIIERE2y23f/?img_index=1) captured a crescent Venus shining in clear daytime skies from Shoreline, Washington, USA at 11:57AM Pacific Time. It also caught the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/) in this single [video frame](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/1jsdrrs/i_captured_the_iss_passing_venus_in_broad/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button&rdt=34311). In close conjunction with the bright planet, the faint outline of the orbital outpost seen at a range of about 400 kilometers appears to be similar in size to the slender planetary crescent. Of course the ISS is much smaller than Venus. [Now appearing](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/whats-up-april-2025-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/) as planet Earth's brilliant morning star and climbing above the eastern horizon in predawn skies, inner planet Venus was nearly 45 million kilometers from Shoreline.
