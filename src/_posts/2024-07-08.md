Do other stars have planets like our Sun? Surely they do, and evidence includes slight star wobbles created by the gravity of orbiting [exoplanets](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/) and slight star dimmings caused by orbiting planets moving in front. In all, there have now been over 5,500 [exoplanets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190710.html) discovered, including thousands by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s space-based [Kepler](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/kepler/) and [TESS](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/tess/) missions, and over 100 by [ESO](https://www.eso.org/public/)'s ground-based [HARPS](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/lasilla/36/harps/) instrument. [Featured here](https://www.halcyonmaps.com/#/the-exoplanet-zoo/) is an illustrated guess as to what some of these [exoplanets](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/what-is-an-exoplanet/overview/) might look like. [Neptune](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230527.html)\-type planets occupy the middle and are colored blue because of blue-scattering [atmospheric methane](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190422.html) they might contain. On the sides of the illustration, [Jupiter](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/)\-type planets are shown, colored tan and red from the scatterings of atmospheric gases that likely include small amounts of [carbon](https://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml). Interspersed are many Earth-type [rocky planet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230201.html)s of many colors. As more [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_planets) are discovered and [investigated](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/nasas-webb-reveals-steamy-atmosphere-of-distant-planet-detail/), humanity is developing a [better understanding](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cc/1f/d2/cc1fd22b9cd2bf70dc1068310a0a3067.jpg) of how common Earth-like planets are, and how common life might be in the universe.
