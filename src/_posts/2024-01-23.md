How well do you know the night sky? OK, but how well can you identify famous sky objects in a [very deep](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210802.html) image? Either way, here is a test: see if you can find some well-known [night-sky icons](https://science.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/) in a deep image filled with faint nebulosity. This image contains the [Pleiades star cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221205.html), [Barnard's Loop](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050420.html), [Horsehead Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231120.html), [Orion Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210629.html), [Rosette Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120214.html), [Cone Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230110.html), [Rigel](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220124.html), [Jellyfish Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231226.html), [Monkey Head Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061208.html), [Flaming Star Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230301.html), [Tadpole Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221219.html), [Aldebaran](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200122.html), [Simeis 147](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160425.html), [Seagull Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230119.html) and the [California Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221022.html). To find their real locations, [here is an annotated image version](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2401/SeagullToCalifornia_Symon_2000_Annotated.jpg). The reason this task might be difficult is similar to the reason it is initially hard to identify familiar [constellations](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/) in a very [dark sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200408.html): the tapestry of our night sky has an extremely deep [hidden complexity](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230717.html). The [featured composite](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1001049588109535) reveals some of [this complexity](https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article27598932.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200d/1_SWNS_SURPRISED_DOG_008.jpg) in a [mosaic of 28 images](https://www.woodlandsobservatory.com/SeagullCalifornia/SeagullToCalifornia2023.htm) taken over 800 hours from dark skies over [Arizona](https://youtu.be/sj13_HK_WUU?t=29), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).
