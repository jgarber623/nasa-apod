Why is there a triangle hovering over the Sun? Although the shape is unusual, the type of structure is not: it is part of an evolving [solar prominence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_prominence). Looping magnetic fields on the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) channel the flow of energetic particles, sometimes holding glowing gaseous structures aloft for months. A [prominence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180527.html) glows brightly because it contains particularly hot, dense, or opaque solar [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_\(physics\)). The [surprising](https://petsonme.com.au/blog//wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pugheadtilt.jpg) triangular structure occurred last week. Larger than our Earth, the [iconic prominence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230801.html) was imaged by several solar photographers and [documented](https://www.facebook.com/APOD.Sky/videos/1537986243787259) by NASA's [Solar Dynamic Observatory](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) to form and violently dissipate in about a day. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_K1nhxMRrP/) was captured in a color of [red light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-alpha) emitted strongly by [hydrogen](https://periodic.lanl.gov/1.shtml). Below, [solar fibrils](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150217.html) carpet the [Sun's chromosphere](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/chromos.shtml), while the background sky is so faint in comparison that no stars are visible. Our Sun's surface has been [quite active](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240615.html) this year.
