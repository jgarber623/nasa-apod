What is that strange brown ribbon on the sky? When observing the star cluster [NGC 4372](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_4372), observers frequently take note of an unusual dark streak nearby running about three [degrees](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/degrees.html) in length. The streak, actually a long [molecular cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html), has become known as the Dark Doodad Nebula. (Doodad is slang for a [thingy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thingy) or a [whatchamacallit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whatchamacallit)) Pictured here, the [Dark Doodad Nebula](https://skyandtelescope.org/online-gallery/dark-doodad-nebula/) sweeps across the center of a rich and colorful starfield. Its dark color comes from a high concentration of [interstellar dust](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dust+Grain) that preferentially scatters [visible](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) light. The [globular star cluster](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/globular-clusters-stellar-pockets/) NGC 4372 is visible as the [fuzzy white spot](https://i1.pickpik.com/photos/957/342/365/cat-kitten-puppy-fluffy-preview.jpg) on the far left, while the bright blue star [gamma Muscae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_Muscae) is seen to the cluster's upper right. The [Dark Doodad Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Doodad_Nebula) can be found with strong [binoculars](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/binoculars.html) toward the southern [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/) of the [Fly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly#/media/File:Fossil_insect_Diptera,_Brachycera_in_Baltic_amber._Age_50_Mill._years_\(the_Lower_Eocene\).jpg) ([Musca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musca)).
