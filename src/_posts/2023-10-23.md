The moon is nearly half- lit by the distant Sun and shows a complex surface including the colors yellow, orange, and dark brown. Near the top, the plume of an active volcano can be seen.

There goes another one! Volcanoes on [Jupiter](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/)'s moon [Io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)) keep erupting. To investigate, [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/about/)'s robotic [Juno](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/juno) [spacecraft has begun a series of visits to this](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/undefined) [very strange](https://www.intermountainpet.com/hubfs/Blog_Images/Dogs-tilting-their-heads.jpg) moon. [Io is about the size of Earth's moon](https://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/web/assets/pictures/20130619_solar-system-major-moons-by-location-withtext.jpg), but because of [gravitational flexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanism_on_Io#Heat_source) by Jupiter and other moons, Io's interior gets heated and its surface has become [covered with volcanoes](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110522.html). The featured image is from [last week's flyby](https://youtu.be/yJUJmI8YI_E), passing within 12,000 kilometers above the dangerously active world. The [surface of Io](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221211.html) is covered with sulfur and frozen sulfur dioxide, making it appear yellow, orange and brown. As hoped, [Juno](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno/) flew by [just as](https://www.universetoday.com/163766/juno-completes-its-closest-flyby-of-io-yet/) a volcano was erupting -- with its faint plume visible near the top of the featured image. Studying Io's volcanoes and plumes helps humanity better understand how [Jupiter's complex system](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220830.html) of moons, rings, and auroras interact. [Juno is scheduled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Io#Juno_spacecraft) to make two flybys of Io during the coming months that are almost 10 times closer: one in December and another in February 2024.
