What was that red glow on the horizon last night? Aurora. Our [unusually active](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230222.html) [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/facts/) produced a [surface explosion](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180902.html) a few days ago that sent out a burst of electrons, protons, and more massive charged nuclei. This [coronal mass ejection](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/what-coronal-mass-ejection-or-cme/) (CME) triggered [auroras](https://spaceweathergallery2.com/index.php?title=aurora) here on Earth that are being reported [unusually far south](https://cdn.petcarerx.com/blog/wp-content-uploads-2015-07-surprise-dog.jpg) in Earth's [northern hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere). For example, this was the first time that [the astrophotographer](https://www.giorgiahoferphotography.com/about-me) captured aurora from her home country of [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). Additionally, many images from these auroras appear quite [red in color](https://www.theaurorazone.com/about-the-aurora/the-science-of-the-northern-lights/the-northern-lights-colours). In the [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzR9tpTOS7k/), the town of [Comelico Superiore](https://youtu.be/6-feWbfrYio) in the Italian Alps is visible in the foreground, with the [central band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220301.html) of our [Milky Way galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) seen rising from the lower left. What draws the eye the most, though, is the bright red [aurora](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/) on the far right. The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzR9tpTOS7k/) is a composite with the foreground and background images taken consecutively with the same camera and from the same location.
