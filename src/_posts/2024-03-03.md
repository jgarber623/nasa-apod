How would you feel if the Sun disappeared? Many eclipse watchers [across the USA](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160821.html) surprised themselves in 2017 with the awe that they felt and the exclamations that they made as the Sun momentarily disappeared behind the Moon. Perhaps expecting just a brief moment of dusk, the spectacle of unusually rapid darkness, breathtakingly bright [glowing beads](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150328.html) around the Moon's edge, shockingly pink [solar prominences](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/what-is-a-solar-prominence), and a strangely [detailed corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170813.html) stretching across the sky caught many a curmudgeon [by](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170908.html) [surprise](https://www.sadanduseless.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/funny-suprised-cat2.jpg). Many of these attributes [were captured](https://vimeo.com/232384839) in the [featured real-time, three-minute video](https://vimeo.com/231484786) of [2017's total solar eclipse](https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/). The [video frames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzWc7adS-RY) were acquired in [Warm Springs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_237pDMVHt8), [Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon) with equipment specifically designed by Jun Ho Oh to track a close-up of the Sun's periphery during eclipse. As the video ends, the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) is seen being reborn on the other side of the [Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220612.html) from where it departed. Next month, on April 8th, a [new total solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/) will be visible in a thin band across North America.
