[On January 18, 2024](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/9540/after-three-years-on-mars-nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-ends/), during its 72nd flight in the thin Martian atmosphere, autonomous [Mars Helicopter Ingenuity](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/) rose to an altitude of 12 meters (40 feet) and hovered for 4.5 seconds above the Red Planet. Ingenuity's 72nd landing was a rough one though. During descent it lost contact with the Perseverance rover about 1 meter above the Martian surface. Ingenuity was able to transmit this image after contact was re-established, [showing the shadow](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia26243-ingenuity-spots-the-shadow-of-its-damaged-rotor-blade) of one of its rotor blades likely damaged during landing. And so, after wildly [exceeding expectations](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/videos/?v=577) during over 1,000 days of exploring Mars, the history-making Ingenuity has ended its flight operations. Nicknamed Ginny, Mars Helicopter Ingenuity became the first aircraft to achieve powered, controlled flight on another planet [on April 19, 2021](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-succeeds-in-historic-first-flight/). Before launch, a small piece of material from the lower-left wing of the [Wright Brothers Flyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer) 1, the first aircraft to achieve powered, controlled flight on planet Earth, was [fixed to the underside](https://images.nasa.gov/details/PIA24291) of Ingenuity's solar panel.
