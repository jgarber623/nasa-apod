The most massive young star cluster in the [Small Magellanic Cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210105.html) is NGC 346, embedded in our small satellite galaxy's largest star forming region some 210,000 light-years distant. [Of course](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap991130.html) the massive stars of NGC 346 are short lived, but very [energetic](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2003/ngc346/index.html). Their winds and radiation [sculpt the edges](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2005/35/1818-Image.html) of the region's dusty molecular cloud triggering star-formation within. The star forming region also appears to contain a large population of [infant stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221118.html). A mere 3 to 5 million years old and not yet [burning hydrogen](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/genesismission/science/module1/index.html) in their cores, the [infant stars](https://chandra.harvard.edu/edu/formal/stellar_ev/story/index2.html) are strewn about the embedded star cluster. [This spectacular infrared view](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-101) of NGC 346 is from the James Webb Space Telescope's [NIRcam](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZSEW1TZ51BHG0EGW2EZP). Emission from atomic hydrogen ionized by the massive stars' energetic radiation as well as molecular hydrogen and dust in the star-forming molecular cloud is detailed in pink and orange hues. [Webb's sharp image](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2023/101/01GNYMNTMKSZ98TE3YD5PQY2VD) of the young star-forming region spans 240 light-years at the distance of the Small Magellanic Cloud.
