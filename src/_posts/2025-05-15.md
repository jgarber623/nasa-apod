[This shadowy landscape](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19947) of majestic mountains and icy plains stretches toward the horizon on a small, distant world. It was captured from a range of about 18,000 kilometers when [New Horizons looked back toward Pluto](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250515.html), 15 minutes after the spacecraft's closest approach on July 14, 2015. The dramatic, low-angle, [near-twilight](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap071227.html) scene follows rugged mountains formally known as Norgay Montes from foreground left, and Hillary Montes along the horizon, [giving way to smooth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150718.html) Sputnik Planum at right. Layers of Pluto's tenuous atmosphere are also revealed in the backlit view. With a strangely familiar appearance, the frigid terrain likely includes ices of nitrogen and carbon monoxide with water-ice mountains rising up to 3,500 meters (11,000 feet). That's comparable in height to the [majestic mountains](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140801.html) of planet Earth. The Plutonian landscape is 380 kilometers (230 miles) across.
