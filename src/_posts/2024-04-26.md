[In northern hemisphere spring](https://earthsky.org/favorite-star-patterns/spring-triangle-regulus-arcturus-spica/), bright star Regulus is easy to spot above the eastern horizon. The alpha star of the constellation Leo, Regulus is the spiky star centered in this [telescopic field of view](https://astrophoto-hannover.de/regulus.html). A mere 79 light-years distant, [Regulus](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/regulus.html) is a [hot, rapidly spinning star](https://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/best-regulus-the-heart-of-the-lion/) that is known to be part of a multiple star system. Not quite lost in the glare, the fuzzy patch just below Regulus is diffuse starlight from small galaxy Leo I. Leo I is a [dwarf spheroidal galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_(dwarf_galaxy)), a member of the [Local Group](http://www.seds.org/messier/more/local.html) of galaxies dominated by our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) and the Andromeda Galaxy ([M31](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap051222.html)). About 800 thousand light-years away, Leo I is thought to be the most distant of the known small satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way. [But dwarf galaxy Leo I](https://www.sci.news/astronomy/dwarf-spheroidal-galaxy-leo-i-black-hole-10328.html) has shown [evidence](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...956L..37P/abstract) of a supermassive black hole at its center, comparable in mass to the black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
