Chicago, in a way, is like a modern [Stonehenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge). The way is east to west, and the time is today. Today, and every [equinox](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210922.html), the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) will set exactly to the west, everywhere on [Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/). Therefore, today in [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago), the Sun will set directly down the long equatorially-aligned [grid of streets](https://www.domu.com/blog/decoding-the-chicago-street-grid-system) and buildings, an event dubbed [#chicagohenge](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23chicagohenge). [Featured here](https://twitter.com/anthony_artese/status/910309187049148417) is a [Chicago Henge](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-viewing-chicagohenge-when-and-how-it-works-20150922s-htmlstory.html) picture taken during the [equinox](https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/tag/equinox/) in mid-September of 2017 looking along part of Upper [Wacker Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacker_Drive). [Many cities](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2016/03/mapping-street-numbering-us-new-york-philadelphia/472809/), though, have [streets](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240319.html) or other [features](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170621.html) that are [well-aligned](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140706.html) to Earth's spin axis. Therefore, quite possibly, your [favorite street](http://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/police-rescue-sloth-cross-highway-ecuador-6.jpg) may also run east - west. Tonight at sunset, with a quick glance, you can [actually find out](https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/00/34/33/73/1000_F_34337307_NVRxBN6qAPMSzwlLvHk91LZHTnPPemts.jpg).
