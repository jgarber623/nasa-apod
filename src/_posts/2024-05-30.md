Why does a cloudy moon sometimes appear colorful? The [effect](https://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/corform.htm), called a lunar [corona](https://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/corona.htm), is created by the quantum mechanical [diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction) of light around individual, similarly-sized water droplets in an [intervening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgiOjqTiwn8) but mostly-transparent cloud. Since light of different colors has [different wavelengths](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro), each color [diffracts](https://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/diffraction) differently. [Lunar coronae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_\(optical_phenomenon\)) are one of the few [quantum mechanical](https://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=21334) color effects that can be [easily seen](http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/65397/quantum-mechanics-and-everyday-nature) with the [unaided eye](https://images.freeimages.com/images/large-previews/755/dog-looking-at-the-camera-1411251.jpg). [Solar corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160111.html)e are also sometimes evident. The featured image was taken last month from [Paris](https://youtu.be/72kRM86V-dw), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France). The [blue beacon](https://www.toureiffel.paris/en/news/history-and-culture/beacon-covering-whole-paris-region) emanating from the [Eiffel Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower) did not affect the [colorful lunar corona](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190916.html).
