[Orion seems](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44273/the-star-splitter) to come up sideways, climbing over a distant mountain range in this deep skyscape. [The wintry](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231223.html) scene was captured from southern Poland on the northern hemisphere's long solstice night. [Otherwise unseen](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090411.html) nebulae hang in the sky, revealed by the camera modified to record red [hydrogen-alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-alpha) light. The nebulae lie near the edge of the Orion molecular cloud and [join the Hunter's](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120119.html) familiar belt stars and bright giants Betelgeuse and Rigel. Eye of Taurus the Bull, yellowish [Aldebaran anchors](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121224.html) the V-shaped Hyades star cluster near top center. Still, near opposition in planet Earth's sky, the Solar System's [ruling gas giant](https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/) Jupiter is the brightest celestial beacon above this horizon's snowy peaks.
