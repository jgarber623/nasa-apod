What does a supernova remnant sound like? Although [sound](https://method-behind-the-music.com/mechanics/physics/) is a compression wave in matter and does not carry into [empty space](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151206.html), [interpretive sound](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap201216.html) can help listeners appreciate and understand a visual image of a [supernova remnant](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/supernova_remnants.html) in a new way. Recently, the Jellyfish Nebula ([IC 443](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_443)) has been sonified quite creatively. In the [featured sound-enhanced video](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2024/sonify8/), when an imaginary line passes over a star, [the sound](https://plus.nasa.gov/video/listen-to-the-universe/) of a drop falling into water is played, a sound particularly relevant to the nebula's [aquatic namesake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish). Additionally, when the descending line crosses gas that glows red, a low [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tone) is played, while green sounds a middle tone, and blue produces a tone with a relatively high [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)). Light from the supernova that created the [Jellyfish Nebula](https://youtu.be/ysZK_tNeh38) left approximately 35,000 years ago, when [human](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190818.html)ity was in the [stone age](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4261235446_1ab55b702b_o.png). The nebula will slowly disperse over the next million years, although the [explosion](https://youtu.be/wymMn-SmALY) also created a dense [neutron star](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/neutron-stars-are-weird/) which will remain indefinitely.
