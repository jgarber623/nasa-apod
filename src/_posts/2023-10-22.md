What does this aurora look like to you? While braving the cold to watch the skies above northern [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) early one morning in 2013, a most unusual aurora appeared. The [aurora](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/aurora/en/) definitely appeared to be [shaped](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161023.html) like _something_, but what? Two ghostly [possibilities recorded](http://blue-moon.ca/2013feb.html) by the astrophotographer were "witch" and "goddess of dawn", but please [feel free to suggest](https://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=231022) your own [Halloween-enhanced](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b4/aa/bc/b4aabcab1b37ac44839687b434e1d938.jpg) impressions. Regardless of fantastical [pareidolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia) interpretations, the pictured aurora had a [typical green](http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/4D.html) color and was surely caused by the scientifically commonplace action of high-energy particles from space interacting with [oxygen](http://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml) in [Earth's upper atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/earths-upper-atmosphere/). In the image foreground, at the bottom, is a frozen [Alexandra Falls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DioO92W6iaQ), while [evergreen trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen) cross the middle.
