What's that in the sky? Above the city, above most clouds, far in the distance: it's a comet. [Pictured](https://www.instagram.com/p/DE-ySI9vNJR/), the impressive tail of Comet [C/2024 G3 (ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_G3_\(ATLAS\)) was imaged from [Bras√≠lia](https://youtu.be/X-FXTAakciw), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil) four days ago. Last week the evolving [comet rounded the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250120.html) well inside the orbit of planet Mercury, going so close there was early concern that it might [break up](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230903.html) -- and [recent evidence](https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&day=20&month=01&year=2025) that it really did. At one point near perihelion, [Comet ATLAS](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/grab-your-binoculars-for-comet-atlass-brief-sunset-show/) was so bright that sightings were even reported [during the day](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1255198816/photo/cat-wearing-sunglasses-outdoors.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=nqyNEvky_3JQRzPVYUsR_ChfSYJb4BscZ74XiaVSLXw=) -- over the bright sky near the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) -- by [careful observers](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/safety/). Over the past few days, [Comet ATLAS](https://theskylive.com/c2024g3-info) has developed a [long tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241007.html) that has been partly visible with unaided eyes after sunset, most notably in [Earth's southern hemisphere](https://www.timeanddate.com/geography/southern-northern-hemisphere.html).
