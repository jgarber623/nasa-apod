[Two protostars are hidden](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2025/news-2025-111) in a single pixel near the center of a striking hourglass-shaped nebula in this near-infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope. The [actively forming](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/nasa-webb-wows-with-incredible-detail-in-actively-forming-star-system/) star system lies in a dusty molecular cloud cataloged as Lynds 483, some 650 light-years distant toward the constellation [Serpens Cauda](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/serpens.html). Responsible for the stunning [bipolar outflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_outflow), the collapsing protostars have been blasting out collimated energetic jets of material over tens of thousands of years. Webb's high-resolution view shows the violence of star-formation in dramatic detail as twisting shock fronts expand and collide with slower, denser material. The premier close-up of the star-forming region spans less than 1/2 a light-year within [dark nebula Lynds 483](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2025/111/01JM0482S0M2GV0DHB9P76QK14).
