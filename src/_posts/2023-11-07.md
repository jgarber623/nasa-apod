It moved across the surface of [Mars](https://mars.nasa.gov/#red_planet/2) -- what was it? A [dust devil](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120413.html). Such spinning columns of rising air are heated by the warm surface and are [also common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_devil) in warm and dry areas on [planet Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/facts/). Typically lasting only a few minutes, [dust devils](https://youtu.be/HYvIsarm9_0) become visible as they pick up loose red-colored dust, leaving the darker and heavier sand beneath intact. Dust devils not only look cool -- they can leave [visible trails](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031230.html), and have been credited with unexpected [cleanings of the surfaces of solar panels](https://www.astronomy.com/space-exploration/mars-dust-devil-whisks-spirit-clean/). The images in the [featured](https://www.flickr.com/photos/192429429@N06/53236541159/in/pool-apods/) [AI-interpolated video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Interframe_motion_interpolation.webm) were captured in [early August](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7IDwMTcpv8w) by the Perseverance rover currently [searching](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/science/) for signs of ancient life in Jezero Crater. The [six-second time-lapse video](https://www.flickr.com/photos/192429429@N06/53236541159/in/pool-apods/) encapsulates a real duration of just over one minute. Visible in the distance, the [spinning dust devil](https://youtu.be/4aswtt6Cobo) was estimated to be passing by at about 20 kilometers per hour and extend up about 2 kilometers high.
