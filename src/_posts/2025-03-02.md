Have you heard about the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field? Either way, you've likely not [heard about it like this](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/33/63/f6/3363f6be8a0b534cd852395723dd6700.jpg) -- please run your cursor over the featured image and listen! The [Hubble Ultra-Deep Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field) (HUDF) was created in 2003-2004 with the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/overview/about-hubble/) staring for a long time toward near-empty space so that distant, [faint galaxies](https://esahubble.org/science/deep_fields/) would become visible. One of the most famous images in astronomy, the [HUDF](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040309.html) is featured here in a vibrant way -- with sonified distances. Pointing to a galaxy will play a [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note) that indicates its approximate redshift. Because [redshift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U4O8XB14tg)s shift light toward the red end of the [spectrum of light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro), they are depicted here by a shift of tone toward the low end of the [spectrum of sound](http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/sound.spectrum.html). The further the galaxy, the greater its [cosmological redshift](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130408.html) (even if it appears blue), and the lower the tone that will be played. The average galaxy in the [HUDF](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200726.html) is about 10.6 billion [light years](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) away and sounds like an [F#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies). What's the [most distant galaxy](https://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=250302) you can find?
