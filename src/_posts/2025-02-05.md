Where is Comet ATLAS going? In the [featured time-lapse video](https://www.instagram.com/p/DFdvObFxHO9/), the comet is not itself moving very much, but the [Earth's rotation](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090909.html) makes it appear to be setting [over a hill](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210921.html). The [Comet C/2024 G3 (ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_G3_\(ATLAS\)) sequence was captured with an ordinary camera on January 22 from the [Araucanía Region](https://youtu.be/6dVlY85KzpA) in central [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile). Comet ATLAS has been an impressive site in the evening skies of [Earth](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/)'s [Southern Hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere) over the past few weeks, so bright and awe-inspiring that it may eventually become known as the [Great Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_comet) of 2025. Unfortunately, [Comet G3 ATLAS](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250126.html) is [not going anywhere anymore](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/07/9c/3e/079c3ea0dce59cc171629800294b0f3d.jpg) because its central [nucleus broke up](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/comet-atlas-caught-in-the-act-of-disintegration/) during its close pass to the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) last month. Some of the comet's [scattered remains](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230903.html) of [rocks and ice](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/) will continue to [orbit the Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240811.html), some in nearly the same outward section of the orbit that the [comet's nucleus](https://www.planetary.org/space-images/cometary-nuclei-to-scale) would have taken.
