What's happened to our Sun? Nothing very unusual -- it just [threw a filament](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101215.html). Toward the middle of 2012, a [long](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150210.html) standing [solar filament](http://solar.physics.montana.edu/ypop/Program/hfilament.html) suddenly erupted into space, producing an energetic [coronal mass ejection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection) (CME). [The filament](https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/a-huge-solar-filament-erupts-into-space) had been held up for days by the Sun's ever changing [magnetic field](http://solar-center.stanford.edu/magnetism/magneticfields.html) and the timing of the eruption was [unexpected](https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/e8/ac/ab/e8acab27a9225b707a2467bf3bc27015.jpg). [Watched closely](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/sets/72157631408160534/) by the Sun-orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory, the resulting [explosion](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/7931868316/in/set-72157631408160534) [shot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/7938936660/in/set-72157631408160534) electrons and ions into the Solar System, some of which arrived at Earth three days later and impacted Earth's [magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere), causing visible [auroras](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120321.html). Loops of plasma surrounding the [active region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_region) can be seen above the erupting filament in [the featured](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/7931831962/in/set-72157631408160534/) [ultraviolet](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) image. Our Sun is nearing the [most active](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/how-nasa-tracked-the-most-intense-solar-storm-in-decades/) time in its [11-year cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle), creating many [coronal holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_hole) that allow for the ejection of [charged particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle) into space. As before, these charged particles can [create auroras](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.431368006258449&type=3).
