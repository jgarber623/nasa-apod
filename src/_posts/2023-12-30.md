Known to some in the northern hemisphere as [December's](https://science.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/) Cold Moon or [the Long Night Moon](https://earthsky.org/tonight/december-full-moon-mimics-the-june-sun/), the last full moon of 2023 is rising in this surreal mountain and skyscape. The Daliesque scene was captured in a single exposure with a camera and long telephoto lens near Monte Grappa, Italy. The full moon is [not melting, though](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persistence_of_Memory). Its stretched and distorted appearance near the horizon is caused as refraction along the line of sight changes and creates shifting images or [mirages of the bright lunar disk](https://atoptics.co.uk/blog/full-moon-mirage/). The changes in atmospheric refraction correspond to [atmospheric layers](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170120.html) with sharply different temperatures and densities. Other effects of atmospheric refraction produced by the long sight-line to this full moon rising include the thin red rim seen faintly on the distorted lower edge of the Moon and a thin [green rim](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220715.html) along the top.
