Will our Sun look like this one day? The [Helix Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix_Nebula) is one of brightest and closest examples of a [planetary nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula), a gas [cloud created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXNSYo8ZdoU) at the end of the life of a Sun-like star. The outer gasses of the star [expelled into space](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200209.html) appear from our vantage point as if we are looking down a [helix](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Helix.html). The remnant central stellar core, destined to become a [white dwarf star](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/dwarfs2.html), glows in light so [energetic](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves) it causes the previously expelled gas to [fluoresce](https://youtu.be/maniMjcvS7M). The [Helix Nebula](http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n7293.html), given a technical designation of [NGC 7293](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap041229.html), lies about 700 [light-years](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) away towards the [constellation](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question9.html) of the Water Bearer ([Aquarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(constellation))) and spans about 2.5 light-years. The [featured picture](https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/HawaiianStarlight/AIOM/English/CFHT-Coelum-AIOM-Mar2017.html) was taken with the [Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope](https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/about/) (CFHT) located atop a [dormant](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2189295/cat-sleeps-hilarious-position.webp?w=790&f=ec34c52c69823215278d8530cb8eeaf3) volcano in [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii#/media/File:Hawaii_in_United_States_(zoom)_(US50)_(-grid).svg), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). A [close-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwAKNMC2PeM) of the [inner edge](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080413.html) of the [Helix Nebula](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/products/01ECM7VDHPRDMC73331VG00T60.html) shows complex gas knots of [unknown origin](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...573L..55H/abstract).
