How different are these two streaks? The streak on the upper right is [Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_\(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS\)) showing an [impressive dust tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241111.html). The [comet](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/) is a large and dirty iceberg that entered the inner [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/) and is [shedding](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151118.html) gas and dust as it is warmed by the Sun's light. The streak on the lower left is a [meteor](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/meteors-meteorites/) showing an impressive [evaporation trail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240714.html). The meteor is a small and cold rock that entered the [Earth's atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/general/what-is-earths-atmosphere/) and is shedding gas and dust as it is [warmed](https://packaged-media.redd.it/v0wnspc5dg2e1/pb/m2-res_650p.mp4?m=DASHPlaylist.mpd&v=1&e=1732327200&s=e59e3c622e0eebc98f47bd85e214ecb24461a327) by molecular collisions. The meteor was likely once part of a comet or [asteroid](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/) -- perhaps later composing part of its tail. The meteor was [gone in a flash](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240826.html) and was only caught by coincidence during a series of exposures documenting the [comet's long tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241021.html). The featured image was captured just over a month ago from [Sichuan Province](https://youtu.be/so00OtYwHJ8) in [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China).
