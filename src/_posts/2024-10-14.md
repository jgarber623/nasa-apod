Go outside at sunset tonight and see a comet! [C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshanâ€“ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_\(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS\)) has become visible in the early evening sky in northern locations to the unaided eye. To [see the comet](https://earthsky.org/space/comet-c-2023-a3-sep-oct-2024-tsuchinshan-atlas/), look west through a sky with a low horizon. If the sky is clear and dark enough, you will not even need binoculars -- the [faint tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240925.html) of the [comet should be visible](https://youtu.be/Nkj_ZrZsQC0?t=158) just above the horizon for about an hour. [Pictured](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBDSNJkOzGc/), Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS was captured two nights ago over the [Lincoln Memorial](https://www.nps.gov/linc/index.htm) monument in [Washington, DC](https://youtu.be/qdGin1IPgh0), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). With each passing day at sunset, the [comet](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/comets/en/) and its [changing tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241007.html) should be higher and higher in the sky, although exactly how bright and how long its tails will be [can only be guessed](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/banner-three-pets-atttentive-thinking-600nw-2136132101.jpg).
