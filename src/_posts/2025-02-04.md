Yes, but can your rainbow do this? Late in the day, the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) set as usual toward the west. However, on this day, the more interesting display was [180 degrees](https://byjus.com/maths/180-degree-angle/) around -- toward the east. There, not only was a [rainbow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221127.html) visible, but an impressive display of [anticrepuscular rays](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101128.html) from the rainbow's center. In the featured image from [Lekeitio](https://youtu.be/XuEXupOjC8A) in northern [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain), the Sun is behind the camera. The [rainbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow) resulted from sunlight reflecting back from falling rain. [Anticrepuscular rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticrepuscular_rays) result from sunlight, blocked by some clouds, going all the way [around the sky](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190624.html), overhead, and appearing to converge on the opposite horizon -- an optical illusion. [Rainbows](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221227.html) by themselves can be exciting to see, and [anticrepuscular rays](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200318.html) a [rare treat](https://i.pinimg.com/550x/81/21/c0/8121c0291fa14d1fe52b9eb007741cac.jpg), but capturing them both together is even more unusual -- and can look both serene and surreal.
