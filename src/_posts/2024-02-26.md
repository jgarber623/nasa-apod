What if there were two moons in the sky -- and they eclipsed each other? This happens on [Mars](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/). The [featured video](https://www.flickr.com/photos/192271236@N03/53339474142/in/photostream/) shows a version of this unusual eclipse from space. Pictured are the two moons of Mars: the larger [Phobos](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230731.html), which orbits closer to the red planet, and the smaller [Deimos](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010902.html), which orbits further out. [The sequence](https://www.flickr.com/photos/192271236@N03/53339522052/) was captured last year by the [ESA](https://www.esa.int/)â€™s [Mars Express](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express), a robotic spacecraft that itself orbits [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars). A similar [eclipse is visible](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220509.html) from the Martian surface, although very rarely. From the surface, though, the closer moon [Phobos would appear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon)#/media/File:Phobos_fly-by_animation_ESA223006.gif) to pass in front of farther moon Deimos. [Most oddly](https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article27598932.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_SWNS_SURPRISED_DOG_008.jpg), both moons orbit Mars so close that they appear to [move backwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonrise_and_moonset#Direction) when compared to [Earth's Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220421.html) from Earth, both rising in west and setting in the east. [Phobos](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220703.html), the closer moon, orbits so close and so fast that it passes nearly overhead about three times a day.
