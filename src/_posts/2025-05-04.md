How fast can a black hole spin? If any object made of regular matter spins too fast -- it breaks apart. But a [black hole](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/) might not be able to break apart -- and its maximum spin rate is really unknown. Theorists usually model rapidly rotating black holes with the [Kerr solution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_black_hole) to Einstein's [General Theory of Relativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity), which predicts several [amazing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_process) and [unusual](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_TU6T4-0LU) things. Perhaps its most easily testable prediction, though, is that matter entering a [maximally rotating black hole](http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/SpinNEW.pdf) should be last seen orbiting at near the speed of light, as seen from far away. [This prediction](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-nustar-helps-solve-riddle-of-black-hole-spin/) was tested by NASA's [NuSTAR](https://nustar.caltech.edu/) and ESA's [XMM](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/XMM-Newton) satellites by observing the supermassive [black hole](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/black-holes/) at the center of [spiral galaxy NGC 1365](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap241113.html). The near [light-speed limit](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111018.html) was [confirmed by measuring](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013Natur.494..449R/abstract) the heating and [spectral line broadening](https://physicsopenlab.org/2017/09/07/spectral-lines-broadening/) of nuclear emissions at the inner edge of the surrounding [accretion disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140323.html). [Pictured here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia16695-black-holes-monsters-in-space-artists-concept/) is an artist's illustration depicting an accretion disk of normal [matter swirling](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/02/27/spinning_black_hole_scientists_measure_supermassive_black_hole_rotating.html) around a black hole, with a [jet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110828.html) emanating from the top. Since matter randomly falling [into the black hol](https://apod.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html)[e](http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=21666) should not spin up a black hole this much, the NuSTAR and XMM measurements also validate the existence of the [surrounding accretion disk](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080811.html).
