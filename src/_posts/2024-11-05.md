Why were the statues on Easter Island built? No one is sure. What is sure is that over 900 large stone statues called [moai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moai)s exist there. The [Rapa Nui (Easter Island)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island) moais stand, on average, over twice as tall as a person and have over 200 times as much mass. It is thought that the [unusual statues](https://youtu.be/luv9B2fJIEM) were created about 600 years ago in the images of local leaders of a vibrant and ancient civilization. Rapa Nui has been declared by [UNESCO](https://www.unesco.org/) to a [World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site). [Pictured here](https://www.instagram.com/p/DA6GNhAslfT/), some of the [stone giants](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/civilization/giants.html) were imaged last month under the [central band](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110710.html) of our [Milky Way](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) galaxy. [Previously unknown moais](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/02/new-easter-island-moai-statue-discovered-in-volcano-crater) are [still being discovered](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/close-scottish-fold-cat-head-600nw-1276621966.jpg).
