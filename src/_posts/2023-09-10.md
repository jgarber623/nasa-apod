What is this person doing? In 2012, an annular eclipse of the Sun was visible over a [narrow path](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEgoogle/SEgoogle2001/SE2012May20Agoogle.html) that crossed the northern Pacific Ocean and [several western US states](https://stardate.org/content/ring-fire). In an annular solar [eclipse](https://www.nasa.gov/content/eclipses-and-transits-overview), the Moon is too far from the Earth to [block out](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170301.html) the entire Sun, leaving the Sun [peeking out](https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/2022/10/gettyimages-696166057.jpg) over the Moon's disk in a [ring of fire](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130509.html). To capture this [unusual solar event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtkoAlwIpWY), an industrious photographer drove from [Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona) to [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico) to find just the right vista. After setting up and just as the [eclipsed Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120522.html) was setting over a ridge about 0.5 kilometers away, a person unknowingly walked right into the shot. Although grateful for the unexpected human element, the photographer never learned the identity of the [silhouetted](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160501.html) interloper. It appears likely that the person is holding a circular [device](http://www.mreclipse.com/Totality2/TotalityCh11.html) that would enable them to get their own view of the eclipse. [The shot](http://www.cp-pics.com/p533893218/h4d180eaa#h4d180eaa) was taken at sunset on 2012 May 20 at 7:36 pm local time from [a park](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2167595/Stunning-image-shows-boy-watching-solar-eclipse--taken-1-5-miles-away.html) near [Albuquerque](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPkaLjssP54). Next month, on October 14, a different narrow swath across [North and South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas) will be exposed to a [different annular solar eclipse](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/eclipses/2023/oct-14-annular/where-when/), if the sky is clear. Simultaneously, cloud-free observers almost anywhere on either continent will be able to see a [partial solar eclipse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210628.html).
