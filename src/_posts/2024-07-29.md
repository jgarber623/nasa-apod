What's happening above Uluru? A [United Nations World Heritage Site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/), [Uluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluru) is an extraordinary 350-meter high mountain in central [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) that rises sharply from nearly flat surroundings. Composed of [sandstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkose), Uluru has [slowly formed](https://parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/discover/nature/geology/) over the past 300 million years as softer rock eroded away. The [Uluru](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150730.html) region has been a [home to humans](https://ulurutoursaustralia.com.au/blog/the-significance-of-uluru-to-australian-indigenous-culture/) for [over 22,000](https://northernterritory.com/uluru-and-surrounds/destinations/kata-tjuta-the-olgas) years. [Recorded](https://www.instagram.com/p/C87AnVopYM4/) last month, the starry sky above [Uluru](https://youtu.be/xUADPqYbnvI) includes the central band of our [Milky Way galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/), complete with complex dark filaments of [dust](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/D/Dust+Grain), bright red [emission](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181112.html) [nebulas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230515.html), and [billions](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/924327272/photo/gray-kitten-on-black-background.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=uW_WOoIvPX-fwSDLaI2jPemyWNtbKtF64xdd41fDdHg=) of stars.
