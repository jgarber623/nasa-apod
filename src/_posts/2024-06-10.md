Is the Lion Nebula the real ruler of the [constellation Cepheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheus_\(constellation\))? This powerful feline appearing [nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula) is powered by two [massive stars](https://skyandtelescope.org/online-gallery/sh2-132-lion-nebula/), each with a mass over 20 times greater than [our Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun). Formed from [shells of ionized gas](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.405.1976V/abstract) that have expanded, the nebula's energetic matter not only [glows](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230724.html), but is dense enough to contract [gravitationally and form stars](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/science-highlights/exploring-the-birth-of-stars). The angular size of the [Lion](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fzbf8ej9iq1b51.jpg) Nebula, officially named [Sh](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1959ApJS....4..257S/abstract)2-132, is slightly greater than that of the [full moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240602.html). The gaseous [iconic region](https://www.astrobin.com/78pnzo/0/) resides about 10,000 [light year](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/)s away in a [constellation](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/constellations/) named after the King of [Aethopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aethiopia) in [Greek mythology](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-greece/greek-mythology).
