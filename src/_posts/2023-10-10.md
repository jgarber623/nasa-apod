The Great Nebula in Orion has hidden stars. To the unaided eye in visible light, it appears as a small [fuzzy patch](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030207.html) in the [constellation of Orion](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190821.html). But [this image](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2023/09/Orion_Nebula_in_NIRCam_short-wavelength_channel) was taken by the [Webb Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/about-overview/) in a representative-color composite of red and very near [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) light. It confirms with [impressive](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Surprised_orange_cat.jpg) detail that the [Orion Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Nebula) is a busy neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and dark dust. The [rollover image](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2023/09/Orion_Nebula_in_NIRCam_long-wavelength_channel) shows the same image in representative colors further into the [near infrared](https://webb.nasa.gov/content/observatory/instruments/nircam.html). The power behind much of the [Orion Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210629.html) (M42) is the [Trapezium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezium_Cluster) - a cluster of bright stars near the nebula's center. The diffuse and [filamentary glow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190303.html) surrounding the bright stars is mostly heated interstellar [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990509.html). Detailed inspection of these images shows an [unexpectedly large number](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231001231P/abstract) of Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects ([JuMBOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_planet#Jupiter-Mass_Binary_Objects)), pairs of Jupiter-mass objects which might give a clue to how [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve/) are forming. The whole [Orion Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap971201.html) cloud complex, which includes the [Horsehead Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220829.html), will slowly disperse over the next few million years.
