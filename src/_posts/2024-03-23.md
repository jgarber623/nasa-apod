[This close-up from](http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_040776_2115) the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera shows weathered craters and windblown deposits in southern [Acidalia Planitia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_plains_on_Mars). A striking shade of blue in standard HiRISE image colors, to the human eye the area would probably look grey or a little reddish. But human eyes have not gazed across this terrain, unless you count the eyes of NASA astronauts in the scifi novel [_The Martian_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_%28Weir_novel%29) by Andy Weir. The novel chronicles the adventures of Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded at the fictional Mars mission Ares 3 landing site corresponding to the coordinates of this cropped HiRISE frame. For scale Watney's 6-meter-diameter habitat at the site would be about 1/10th the diameter of the large crater. [Of course](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/nasas-journey-mars/), the Ares 3 landing coordinates are only about 800 kilometers north of the (real life) Carl [Sagan Memorial Station](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-renames-mars-lander-in-honor-of-late-carl-sagan), the 1997 [Pathfinder landing site](https://www.uahirise.org/PSP_001890_1995).
