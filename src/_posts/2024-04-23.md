What created this giant X in the clouds? It was the shadow of [contrails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrail) illuminated from below. When airplanes fly, humid [engine](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/UEET/StudentSite/engines.html) exhaust may form water droplets that might freeze in Earth's [cold upper atmosphere](https://cloud1.arc.nasa.gov/solveII/outreach/middleschool-atmos.htm). These persistent [streams of water and ice](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231204.html) scatter light from the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) above and so appear [bright from below](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050513.html). On rare occasions, though, when the Sun is near the horizon, [contrails](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/contrails-k-12.pdf?emrc=9d8066) can be lit from below. These contrails cast long shadows upwards, shadows that usually go unseen unless there is a high cloud deck. But that was just the case over [Istanbul](https://youtu.be/eV6lTEY95yY), [TÃ¼rkiye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey), earlier this month. Contrails occur [all over](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080429.html) planet Earth and, generally, [warm](https://baltimorefishbowl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/catsburritoscoldkittenswrapburrito-03bc734d15d3f1eed350fa0b20e309ed_h.jpg) the Earth when the trap [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) but cool the Earth when they efficiently reflect [sunlight](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230611.html). The image was taken by a surprised photographer in the morning [on the way to work](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200224.html).
