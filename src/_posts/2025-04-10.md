From a garden on planet Earth, 38 hours of exposure with a camera and small telescope produced [this cosmic photo](https://app.astrobin.com/u/Daniel_Yang_K.?i=ldzdz7#gallery) of the M81 galaxy group. In fact, the group's dominant galaxy M81 is near the center of the frame sporting grand spiral arms and a bright yellow core. Also known as Bode's galaxy, M81 itself spans some 100,000 light-years. Near the top is cigar-shaped [irregular galaxy M82](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190723.html). The pair have been locked in gravitational combat for a billion years. [Gravity from each galaxy](https://phys.org/news/2019-11-astronomers-stellar-halo.html) has profoundly affected the other during a series of cosmic close encounters. Their last go-round lasted about 100 million years and likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in massive star forming regions arrayed along [M81](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250327.html)'s spiral arms. [M82](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2001/news-2001-08.html) was left with violent star forming regions too, and colliding gas clouds so energetic that the galaxy [glows in X-rays](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2006/m82/). In the next few billion years, their continuing gravitational encounters will result in a merger, and a [single galaxy will remain](https://science.nasa.gov/asset/hubble/collision-scenario-for-milky-way-and-andromeda-galaxy-encounter/). Another group member, NGC 3077 is below and left of the large spiral M81. Far far away, about 12 million light-years distant the M81 group galaxies are seen toward the northern constellation Ursa Major (the Great Bear). But in the closer foreground the wide-field image is filled with integrated flux nebulae whose faint, [dusty interstellar clouds](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160428.html) reflect starlight above the plane of our own Milky Way galaxy.
