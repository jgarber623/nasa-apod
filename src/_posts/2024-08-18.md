One of the most spectacular solar sights is an erupting prominence. In 2011, NASA's Sun-orbiting [Solar Dynamic Observatory](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/sdo) spacecraft imaged an [impressively large prominence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030223.html) erupting from the surface. The dramatic explosion was captured in ultraviolet light in the [featured time lapse video](https://youtu.be/PBL1RBj-P1g) covering 90 minutes, where a new frame was taken every 24 seconds. The scale of the prominence is huge -- the entire [Earth](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg) would easily fit under the flowing [curtain](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap011203.html) of hot gas. A [solar prominence](http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Program/hfilament.html) is channeled and sometimes held above the Sun's surface by the Sun's [magnetic field](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/the_key.shtml). A quiescent prominence typically lasts about a month and may erupt in a [Coronal Mass Ejection](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/CMEs.shtml) (CME) [expelling hot gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010924.html) into the [Solar System](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/). The energy [mechanism](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ApJ...343..971V/abstract) that creates a [solar prominence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030707.html) is a continuing topic of [research](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/62/75/3062756a297f1e3c22e35f3fe89b3ecc.jpg). Our Sun is again near [solar maximum](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/solar-cycle-25-is-here-nasa-noaa-scientists-explain-what-that-means/) and so very active, featuring numerous erupting prominences and CMEs, one of which resulted in [picturesque](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240814.html) [auroras](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240815.html) just over the past week.
