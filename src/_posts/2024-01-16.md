Do you recognize this constellation? Although it is one of the [most recognizable star groupings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)) on the sky, [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1Pz_MdIEmN/) is a [more full Orion](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap151123.html) than you can see -- an Orion only revealed with long exposure digital camera imaging and [post](https://media.snopes.com/2009/01/rand.jpg)[\-](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/1954-home-computer/) [processing](https://media.snopes.com/2009/01/rand.jpg). Here the cool [red giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant) [Betelgeuse](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100106.html) takes on a strong orange tint as the brightest star on the upper left. [Orion](https://universe.nasa.gov/news/147/discovering-the-universe-through-the-constellation-orion/)'s hot blue stars are numerous, with [supergiant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergiant_star) [Rigel](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180115.html) balancing Betelgeuse on the lower right, and [Bellatrix](http://earthsky.org/tonight/bellatrix-orions-third-brightest-means-female-warrior) at the upper right. Lined up in [Orion's belt](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170604.html) are three stars [all about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD-5ZOipE48) 1,500 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) away, born from the constellation's well-studied [interstellar clouds](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/I/Interstellar+Gas+Cloud). Just below Orion's belt is a bright but fuzzy patch that might also [look familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EjukzL-bJc) -- the stellar nursery known as [Orion's Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171129.html). Finally, just barely visible to the [unaided eye](https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/resources-for-teachers/how-your-eyes-work) but quite striking here is [Barnard's Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard%27s_Loop) -- a huge gaseous emission nebula surrounding Orion's Belt and Nebula discovered over 100 years ago by the pioneering Orion photographer [E. E. Barnard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Emerson_Barnard).
