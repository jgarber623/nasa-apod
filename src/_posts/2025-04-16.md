What created the unusual halo around the Cat's Eye Nebula? No one is sure. What is sure is that the [Cat's Eye Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220710.html) (NGC 6543) is one of the best known [planetary nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula) on the sky. Although haunting symmetries are seen in the bright [central region](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240107.html), [this image](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1231078905687113&set=pb.100063550452442.-2207520000&type=3) was taken to feature its intricately structured outer halo, which spans over three [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) across. [Planetary nebulae](https://youtu.be/Mj06h8BeeOA) have long been appreciated as a final phase [in the life](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/) of a Sun-like star. Only recently however, have some planetaries been [found to have expansive halos](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140522.html), likely formed from material shrugged off during earlier [puzzling episodes](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/12/aa33981-18/aa33981-18.html) in the [star's evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution). While the [planetary nebula phase](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/p/Planetary+Nebulae) is [thought to](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/09/04/08/24/cat-4451003_1280.jpg) last for around 10,000 years, astronomers estimate the age of the [outer filamentary portions](https://youtu.be/tw0VJ1K93PM) of the [Cat's Eye Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_Eye_Nebula)'s halo to be 50,000 to 90,000 years.
