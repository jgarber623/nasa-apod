What’s causing those lines? Objects in the sky sometimes appear [reflected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_\(physics\)) as lines across water — but why? If the water’s surface is smooth, then reflected objects would [appear similarly](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191022.html) -- as spots. But if the [water](https://gpm.nasa.gov/education/water-cycle) is choppy, then there are many places where light from the object can reflect off the water and still come to you -- and so together form, typically, a line. The same effect is frequently seen for the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) just [before sunset](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090924.html) and just [after sunrise](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220924.html). [Pictured](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI3Aq4OI_Fs/) about 10 days ago in [Ibiza](https://youtu.be/yDYCMdbaFdQ), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain), images of the [setting Moon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150929.html), [Venus](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-venus/) (top), and [Saturn](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/) (right, faint) were captured both directly and in line-reflected forms from the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea). The other bright object on the right with a water-reflected line is a [beacon](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191119.html) on a rock to warn passing boats.
