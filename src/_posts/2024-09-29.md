Is this really the famous Pleiades star cluster? Known for its [iconic blue stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap221205.html), the [Pleiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades) is shown here in [infrared light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves) where the surrounding dust outshines the stars. Here, three infrared colors have been mapped into visual colors (R=24, G=12, B=4.6 [micron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre)s). The base images were taken by NASA's orbiting [Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-field_Infrared_Survey_Explorer) (WISE) spacecraft. Cataloged as [M45](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140225.html) and nicknamed the [Seven Sisters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades#Origin_of_name), the [Pleiades](https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1592) star cluster is by chance situated in a [passing dust cloud](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171114.html). The light and [wind](https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dogs-on-joyrides-16__605.jpg)s from the massive Pleiades stars preferentially repel smaller [dust particles](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html), causing the dust to become stratified into [filaments](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120215.html), as seen. The featured image spans about 20 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) at the distance of [the Pleiades](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/M45map.jpg), which lies about 450 light years distant toward the constellation of the Bull ([Taurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_\(constellation\))).
