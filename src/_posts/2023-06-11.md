Here are all the [visible](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight) colors of the [Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/), produced by passing the Sun's light through a [prism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_%28optics%29)\-like device. [The spectrum](https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-sun/) was created at the [McMath-Pierce](https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/kitt-peak-national-observatory/mcmath-pierce-solar-telescope/) [Solar Observatory](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120316.html) and shows, first off, that although our [white](http://solar-center.stanford.edu/SID/activities/GreenSun.html)\-appearing [Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/sun.html) emits light of nearly [every color](https://www.windows2universe.org/sun/spectrum/multispectral_sun_overview.html), it appears brightest in yellow-green light. The dark patches in the [featured spectrum](https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-sun/) arise from gas at or above the [Sun's surface](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160919.html) absorbing sunlight emitted below. Since different types of gas [absorb different colors of light](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/a/absorption+line), it is possible to determine what gasses compose the Sun. [Helium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium), for example, was [first discovered](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-scientists-discovered-helium-first-alien-element-1868-180970057/) in 1870 on a solar spectrum and only [later found](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-XbjFn3aqE) here on [Earth](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/earthlights02_dmsp_big.jpg). Today, the majority of [spectral absorption lines](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/nasa/measuringuniverse/spectroscopy/a/absorptionemission-lines) have been identified - but [not all](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ASPC..336...25A/abstract).
