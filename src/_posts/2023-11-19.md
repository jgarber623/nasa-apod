[That's no](https://youtu.be/8Nho44lGVV8) sunspot. It's the [International Space Station](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160418.html) (ISS) caught passing in front of the Sun. [Sunspot](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap051106.html)s, individually, have a dark central [umbra](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/StarChild/questions/sunspot_dia.gif), a lighter surrounding [penumbra](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060909.html), and [no Dragon capsules attached](https://www.petsworld.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pic-2.jpeg). By contrast, the [ISS](https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/) is a complex and multi-spired mechanism, one of the largest and most [complicated spacecraft](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/science/international-space-station-20-anniversary.html) ever created by [humanity](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190818.html). Also, [sunspots circle](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141022.html) the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/), whereas the [ISS](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap161105.html) orbits the [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220206.html). Transiting the Sun is not very unusual for the [ISS](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050729.html), which orbits the Earth about every 90 minutes, but getting one's location, timing and equipment just right for a [great image](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170828.html) is rare. The [featured picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/COGbC01guiS/) combined three images all taken in 2021 from the same location and at nearly the same time. One image -- overexposed -- captured the faint [prominence](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160306.html)s seen across the top of the Sun, a second image -- underexposed -- captured the complex texture of the [Sun's chromosphere](https://nso.edu/for-public/sun-science/chromosphere/), while the third image -- the hardest to get -- captured the space station as it [shot across](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2105/Chromosphere.mp4) the Sun in a fraction of a second. [Close inspection](https://buenavet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Cat_Fish_Bowl.jpg) of the space station's [silhouette](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140803.html) even reveals a docked [Dragon Crew capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2).
