This supernova shock wave plows through interstellar space at over 500,000 kilometers per hour. Centered and moving upward in the [sharply detailed color composite](https://www.astrobin.com/dl30yu/) its thin, bright, braided filaments are actually long ripples in a cosmic sheet of glowing gas seen almost edge-on. Discovered in the 1840s by [Sir John Herschel](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/blog/curatorial/remembering-sir-john-fw-herschel-1792-1871), the narrow-looking nebula is sometimes known as Herschel's Ray. [Cataloged as NGC 2736](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2003/16/1350-Image.html), its pointed appearance suggests its modern popular name, the Pencil Nebula. The [Pencil Nebula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4rXhOArFw8) is about 800 light-years away. Nearly 5 light-years long it represents only a small part of the [Vela supernova remnant](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100910.html) though. The [enormous Vela remnant itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_Supernova_Remnant) is around 100 light-years in diameter, the expanding [debris cloud of a star](https://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/supernovas.html) that was seen to [explode](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap131001.html) about 11,000 years ago. Initially, the section of the [shock wave](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200202.html) seen as the Pencil nebula was moving at millions of kilometers per hour but has slowed considerably, sweeping up surrounding interstellar material.
