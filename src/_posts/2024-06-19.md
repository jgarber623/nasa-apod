Do dragons fight on the altar of the sky? Although it might appear that way, these dragons are [illusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia) made of thin gas and dust. The [emission nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_nebula) NGC 6188, home to the glowing clouds, is found about 4,000 [light years](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/) away near the edge of a large molecular cloud, unseen at visible wavelengths, in the southern [constellation Ara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_\(constellation\)) (the Altar). Massive, young [stars of](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...531A..73B/abstract) the embedded Ara [OB1 association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_association#Stellar_associations) were formed in that region only a few million years ago, [sculpting](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080313.html) the dark shapes and powering the nebular glow with stellar winds and intense [ultraviolet radiation](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves). The recent [star](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/) formation itself was likely triggered by winds and supernova explosions from previous generations of massive [stars](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/search/stars/), that swept up and compressed the molecular gas. This [impressively](https://cdn.petcarerx.com/blog/wp-content-uploads-2015-07-surprise-dog.jpg) detailed [image](https://www.astrobin.com/ofcovc/C/) spans over 2 degrees (four full Moons), corresponding to over 150 light years at the estimated distance [of NGC 6188](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn9mZpAcbF8).
