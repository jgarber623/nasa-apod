Why is our Sun so [active now](https://spaceweather.com/images2023/02jul23/sunspotcounts.jpg)? No one is sure. An increase in surface activity was expected because [our Sun](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/) is approaching [solar maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum) in 2025. However, last month our Sun sprouted more [sunspot](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230517.html)s than in any month during the entire previous [11-year solar cycle](https://www.livescience.com/33345-solar-cycle-sun-activity.html) -- and even dating back to 2002. The [featured picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/CuZ1M4MoYx6/) is a composite of images taken every day from January to June by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s [Solar Dynamic Observatory](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sdo/main/index.html). Showing a high abundance of sunspots, large individual spots can be tracked across the Sun's disk, left to right, over about two weeks. As a solar cycle continues, sunspots typically [appear closer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%B6rer%27s_law) to the equator. Sunspots are just one way that our Sun displays [surface activity](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141022.html) -- another is [flares](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180902.html) and [coronal mass ejections](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/the-difference-between-flares-and-cmes) (CMEs) that expel particles out into the [Solar System](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/). Since these particles can affect astronauts and electronics, tracking surface disturbances is of more than [aesthetic value](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/70/c4/1970c4a0f2b45435436b547c27b54ea7.png). Conversely, [solar activity](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/the-heliopedia) can have very high aesthetic value -- in the Earth's atmosphere when they trigger aurora.
