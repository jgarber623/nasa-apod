[The December 28 night launch](https://drh68.zenfolio.com/p831025468) of a [Falcon Heavy rocket](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240102.html) from Kennedy Space Center in Florida marked the fifth launch for the rocket's reusable side boosters. About 2 minutes 20 seconds into the flight, the two side boosters separated from the rocket's core stage. Starting just after booster separation, this three minute long exposure captures the pair's remarkable [boostback burns](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mojf8.png), maneuvers executed prior to their return to [landing zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Zones_1_and_2) on planet Earth. While no attempt was made to recover the Falcon Heavy's core stage, both side boosters landed successfully and [can be flown again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_first-stage_boosters#Active). The four previous flights for these side boosters included last October's launch of NASA's [asteroid-bound Psyche mission](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/psyche/).
