These dark pillars may look destructive, but they are creating stars. [This pillar-capturing picture](https://www.flickr.com/photos/151824007@N06/53989685257/) of the [Eagle Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230515.html) combines [visible light](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/09_visiblelight/) exposures taken with the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/) with [infrared](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07_infraredwaves/) images taken with the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/) to highlight [evaporating gaseous globules](https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/1995/news-1995-44.html) (EGGs) emerging from [pillars](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/new-hubble-webb-pillars-of-creation-visualization/) of molecular [hydrogen gas](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010113.html) and [dust](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030706.html). The [giant pillars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150107.html) are [light years](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/cosmic_distance.html) in length and are so dense that interior gas [contracts gravitationally](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/gravc.html) to form [stars](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/). At each [pillar's end](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220314.html), the intense radiation of [bright young](https://img.goodfon.com/wallpaper/big/d/3c/white-smart-cat-kitten-kitty.webp) stars causes low density material to boil away, leaving [stellar nurseries](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/stellar_nurseries.html) of dense [EGGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_%28biology%29) exposed. The [Eagle Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Nebula), associated with the [open star cluster](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/open_clusters.html) [M16](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030921.html), lies about 7000 [light years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/en/) away.
