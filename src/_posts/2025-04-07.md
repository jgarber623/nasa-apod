How much mass do flocculent spirals hide? The [featured image](https://esahubble.org/images/potw2444a/) of [flocculent spiral galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocculent_spiral_galaxy) NGC 4414 was taken with the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010806.html) to help answer this question. [Flocculent](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flocculent) spirals -- galaxies without well-defined spiral arms -- are a quite common form of galaxy, and [NGC 4414](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_4414) is one of the closest. [Stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130606.html) and gas near the visible edge of [spiral galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy) orbit the center so fast that the gravity from a large amount of unseen [dark matter](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/what-is-dark-matter.html) must be present to hold them together. [Understanding](http://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5hfctHc7i1rrgr1no1_1280.jpg) the matter and [dark matter](https://science.nasa.gov/dark-matter/) distribution of NGC 4414 helps humanity calibrate the rest of the galaxy and, by deduction, [flocculent spirals](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cms/astro/cosmos/F/Flocculent+Spiral) in general. Further, calibrating the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder) to [NGC 4414](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...566A..80D) helps humanity calibrate the cosmological distance [scale](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate96.html) of the entire [visible universe](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...509...80S/abstract).
