[This pretty starfield](https://www.frosth.se/2023/05/07/caldwell-14-double-cluster/) spans about three full moons (1.5 degrees) across the heroic northern constellation of [Perseus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_constellation). It holds the famous [pair of open star clusters](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/caldwell-14), h and Chi Persei. Also cataloged as [NGC 869 (top) and NGC 884](http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/n0869.html), both clusters are about 7,000 light-years away and contain stars much younger and hotter than the Sun. Separated by only a few hundred light-years, the clusters are both 13 million years young [based on](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0205130) the ages of their [individual stars](http://www.messier.seds.org/open.html), evidence that they were likely a product of the same star-forming region. Always a rewarding [sight in binoculars](http://10minuteastronomy.wordpress.com/2009/11/21/mission-11-cassiopeia-and-the-double-cluster/), the Double Cluster is even visible to the unaided eye from [dark locations](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060413.html).
