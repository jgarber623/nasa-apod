[Graceful star trail arcs](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220728.html) reflect planet Earth's daily rotation in this colorful night skyscape. To create the timelapse composite, on May 12 consecutive exposures were recorded with a camera fixed to a tripod on the shores of the Ashokan Reservoir, in the Catskills region of New York, USA. North star [Polaris is near](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110514.html) the center of the star trail arcs. The broad trail of a waxing crescent Moon is on the left, casting a strong reflection across the reservoir waters. With [intense solar activity](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/how-nasa-tracked-the-most-intense-solar-storm-in-decades/) driving recent [geomagnetic storms](https://spaceweather.com/), the colorful aurora borealis or northern lights, rare to the region, shine under Polaris and the north celestial pole.
