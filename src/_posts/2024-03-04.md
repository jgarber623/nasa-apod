What's happening across that field? Pictured here are not [auroras](https://www.mtu.edu/tour/copper-country/northern-lights/) but nearby [light pillars](https://atoptics.co.uk/blog/light-pillars/), a phenomenon typically much closer. In most places on [Earth](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100713.html), a lucky viewer can see a [Sun pillar](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap010313.html), a column of light appearing to extend up from the [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) caused by flat fluttering [ice-crystals](https://atoptics.co.uk/blog/real-crystals/) reflecting sunlight from the [upper atmosphere](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/earths-upper-atmosphere/). Usually, these ice [crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal)s evaporate before reaching the ground. During freezing temperatures, however, [flat](https://i.imgur.com/ELtLVZy.jpeg) fluttering [ice crystals](https://www.lwpetersen.com/atmospheric-optics/light-pillars/) may form near the ground in a form of [light snow](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240121.html) sometimes known as a [crystal fog](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231220.html). These ice crystals may then reflect ground lights in columns not unlike a [Sun pillar](http://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=%22sun%20pillar%22). The featured image was taken last month across the [Wulan Butong Grasslands](https://youtu.be/u5ap7c91Sbg) in [Inner Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Mongolia), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China).
