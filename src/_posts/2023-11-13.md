Have you ever seen the Andromeda galaxy? Although [M31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) appears as a faint and fuzzy blob to the unaided eye, the light you see will be over two million years old, making it likely the oldest light you ever will [see directly](http://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-Andromeda-Galaxy). The [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyyyKh4Iq1X/) captured [Andromeda](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230322.html) just before it set behind the [Swiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) [Alps](https://youtu.be/FCPdIvXo2rU) early last year. As cool as it may be to see this [neighboring galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231006.html) to our [Milky Way](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) with your own eyes, long duration camera exposures can pick up many [faint](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140730.html) and [breathtaking details](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150724.html). The [image](https://www.astrobin.com/4eg8q4/B/) is composite of foreground and background images taken [consecutively](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2A5EKK8/two-beautiful-fluffy-cats-in-a-row-closeup-profile-view-the-cat-on-the-left-is-a-norwegian-forest-cat-on-the-right-his-foster-brother-2A5EKK8.jpg) with the same camera and from the same location. Recent data indicate that our [Milky Way](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) Galaxy [will collide and coalesce](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220606.html) with Andromeda galaxy in a few billion years.
