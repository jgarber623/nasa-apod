The tails of Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS were a sight to behold. Pictured, C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshanâ€“ATLAS) was captured near peak impressiveness last week over the [Eastern Sierra](https://youtu.be/wMXS2p3Knzk?t=47) Mountains in [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). The comet not only showed a [bright tail](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210308.html), but a distinct [anti-tail](https://earthsky.org/space/comet-a3-has-an-anti-tail-can-you-see-it/) pointing in nearly the opposite direction. The [globular star](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/star-clusters-inside-the-universes-stellar-collections/) cluster [M5](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190509.html) can be seen on the right, far in the distance. As it approached, it was unclear if this [crumbling iceberg](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150203.html) would [disintegrate](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230903.html) completely as it warmed in the bright sunlight. In reality, the comet survived to become brighter than [any star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars) in the night ([magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude#List_of_apparent_magnitudes) -4.9), but unfortunately was then so [nearly in front of the Sun](https://i0.wp.com/picjumbo.com/wp-content/uploads/dog-with-sunglasses-on-a-paddleboard-free-photo.jpg?w=2210&quality=70) that it was hard for many casual observers to locate. Whether [Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=APOD.Sky&set=a.516503464411569) becomes known as the [Great Comet](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220408.html) of 2024 now depends, in part, on how impressive [incoming](http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iau/cbet/005400/CBET005453.txt) comet [C/2024 S1 (ATLAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2024_S1_\(ATLAS\)) becomes over the next two weeks.
