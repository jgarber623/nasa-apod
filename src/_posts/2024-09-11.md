A natural border between [Slovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia) and [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland) is the [Tatra Mountains](https://youtu.be/x1YiJgA8lpw). A prominent destination for astrophotographers, the Tatras are the highest mountain range in the [Carpathians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains). In the [featured image](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8guodoo5jz/) taken in May, one can see the center of our [Milky Way](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) [galaxy](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/galaxies/) with two of its famous [stellar nurseries](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240425.html), the [Lagoon](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-8/) and [Omega Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap021210.html), just over the top of the Tatras. Stellar nurseries are full of [ionized hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_II_region), a [fundamental component](https://images3.teeshirtpalace.com/images/productImages/purriodic-table-of-cats-periodic--navy-at-garment.webp?crop=1130,1130,x461,y403&width=1500) for the formation of [Earth-abundant water](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/how-much-water-there-earth). As a [fundamental ingredient](https://phys.org/news/2015-05-plentiful-early-universe.html) in all known [forms of life](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/search-for-life/beginnings-life-on-our-world-and-others/), water is a [crucial element](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/ocean-worlds/) in the [Universe](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231231.html). Such [water](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/aqua/when-it-comes-to-water-you-have-to-think-global/) can be seen in the foreground in the form of the [Bialka River](https://youtu.be/tKT-nVjAxto).
