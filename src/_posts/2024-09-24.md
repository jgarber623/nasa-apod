This dusty region is forming stars. Part of a sprawling [molecular cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud) complex that [resembles](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Papio_cynocephalus02.jpg), to some, a rampaging [baboon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baboon), the region is a relatively close by 500 [light-years](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/light-year/) away toward the constellation [Corona Australis](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181129.html). That's about one third the distance of the more famous [stellar nursery](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240425.html) known as the [Orion Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap210707.html). Mixed with bright nebulosities, the brown [dust](http://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html) clouds effectively block light from more distant background stars in the [Milky Way](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/the-milky-way-galaxy/) and [obscure from view](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230129.html) embedded stars still in the process of formation. The eyes of the [dust creature](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/128/590x/Dog-mop-564889.jpg) in the [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/d5z8gm/) are actually blue [reflection nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_nebula)s cataloged as [NGC 6726, 6727, 6729](https://www.astrobin.com/d5z8gm/), and [IC 4812](https://theskylive.com/sky/deepsky/ic4812-object), while the red mouth glows with [light emitted by hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-alpha) gas. Just to the upper left of the baboon's head is [NGC 6723](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_6723), a whole [globular cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster) of stars nearly 30,000 light years in the distance.
