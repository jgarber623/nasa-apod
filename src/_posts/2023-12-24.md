What's that in the center? Like a [butterfly](https://youtu.be/lWOySU_hAz0), a [white dwarf star](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/dwarfs2.html) begins its life by casting off a [cocoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupa#Cocoon) of gas that enclosed its former self. In this analogy, however, the [Sun](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231211.html) would be a [caterpillar](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/blog/2019/05/are-caterpillars-insects/) and the ejected shell of gas would become the [prettiest](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NY-CE236_DOG_DV_20130211182422.jpg) cocoon of all. In the [featured cocoon](https://esahubble.org/images/opo9935e/), the [planetary nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula) [designated](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/undefined) [NGC 2440](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070215.html) contains one of the [hottest white dwarf stars](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap951130.html) known. The [white dwarf](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000910.html) can be seen as the bright orange dot near the image center. Our [Sun](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/) will eventually become a [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf) butterfly, but not for [another 5 billion years](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2022/08/The_Sun_s_future).
