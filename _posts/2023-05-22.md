A nearby star has exploded and humanity's telescopes are turning to monitor it. The supernova, dubbed [SN 2023ixf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_2023ixf), was discovered by Japanese astronomer [Koichi Itagaki](https://www.smallstepstospace.com/content/2014/3/6/amateur-astronomer-koichi-itagaki-improves-supernova-research) three days ago and subsequently located on automated images from the [Zwicky Transient Facility](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/) two days earlier. SN 2023ixf occurred in the photogenic [Pinwheel Galaxy M101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwheel_Galaxy), which, being only about 21 million light years away, makes it the closest supernova seen in the past five years, the [second closest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_82#2014_supernova) in the past 10 years, and the [second supernova](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110826.html) found [in M101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwheel_Galaxy#Supernovae_and_luminous_red_nova) in the past 15 years. Rapid follow up observations already indicate that SN 2023ixf is a [Type II supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova), an explosion that occurs after a massive star runs out of nuclear fuel and collapses. The featured image shows [home spiral galaxy](https://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=m101) two days ago with the [supernova](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/supernova/en/) highlighted, while the roll-over image shows the same galaxy a month before. [SN 2023ixf](https://www.wis-tns.org/astronotes/astronote/2023-119) will likely brighten and remain visible to telescopes for months. Studying such a close and young [Type II supernova](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/t/Type+II+Supernova) may yield [new clues](https://i0.wp.com/theverybesttop10.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Top-10-Best-Images-of-Surprised-Cats-8.jpeg) about [massive stars and how they explode](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/how-do-stars-form-and-evolve).
