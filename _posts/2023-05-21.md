Is this an alien?

Probably not, but of all the animals on Earth, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade">tardigrade</a> might be the best candidate.

That's because <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H0E77TdYnY">tardigrades</a> are known to be able to go for decades without food or water, to survive temperatures from near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero">absolute zero</a> to well above the boiling point of water, to survive pressures from near zero to well above that on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed">ocean floors</a>, and to survive direct exposure to dangerous <a href="https://srag.jsc.nasa.gov/SpaceRadiation/What/What.cfm">radiations</a>.

The far-ranging survivability of these <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090830.html">extremophiles</a> was <a href="http://tardigradesinspace.blogspot.com/">tested</a> in 2011 <i>outside</i> an orbiting space shuttle.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W194GQ6fHI">Tardigrades</a> are so durable partly because they can repair their own <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120821.html">DNA</a> and reduce their body water content to a few percent.

Some of these <a href="https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/scientists-finally-figure-out-why-the-water-bear-is-nearly-unstoppable/">miniature water-bears</a> almost <i>became</i> extraterrestrials in 2011 when they were launched toward to the Martian moon <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap121028.html">Phobos</a>, and again in 2021 when they were launched toward Earth's own moon, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Interplanetary_Flight_Experiment">former</a> launch failed, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beresheet">latter</a> landing crashed.

<a href="http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/tardigrade/index.html">Tardigrades</a> are more common than <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190818.html">human</a>s across most of the Earth.
