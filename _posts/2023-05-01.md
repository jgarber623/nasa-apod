The [Great Carina Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap190507.html) is home to strange stars and iconic nebulas. Named for its [home constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_(constellation)), the huge star-forming region is larger and brighter than the [Great Orion Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap171129.html) but less well known because it is so far south -- and because so [much of humanity lives so far north](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2016/03/histpop.png). The [featured image](https://www.astrobin.com/aweslh/) shows in great detail the northernmost part of the [Carina Nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090524.html). On the bottom left is the [Gabriela Mistral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriela_Mistral) [Nebula](https://telescope.live/gallery/168) consisting of an [emission nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_nebula) of glowing gas (IC 2599) surrounding the small open cluster of stars ([NGC 3324](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_3324)). Above the image center is the larger star cluster [NGC 3293](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_3293), while to its right is the emission nebula Loden 153. The [most famous occupant](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/e9/1d/9c/e91d9c4bd7c0ae81975ac7d7b9695742.jpg) of the [Carina Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula), however, is not shown. [Off the image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carina_Nebula_by_Harel_Boren_(151851961,_modified).jpg) to the lower right is the bright, erratic, and doomed star known as [Eta Carinae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Carinae) -- a star once [one of the brightest stars](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AAS...23134811G/abstract) in the sky and now predicted to explode in a [supernova](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/supernovae1.html) sometime in the next few million years.
