Looping through the Jovian system in the late 1990s, the <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galileo/">Galileo spacecraft</a> recorded stunning views of Europa and uncovered evidence that the moon's icy surface likely hides a deep, global ocean.

Galileo's Europa image data has been <a href="https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/?IDNumber=PIA19048">remastered here</a>, with improved calibrations to produce a color image approximating what the human eye might see.

Europa's long curving fractures <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/&#10;nasa-scientists-confirm-water-vapor-on-europa">hint at the subsurface liquid water</a>.

The tidal flexing <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160401.html">the large moon experiences</a> in its elliptical orbit around Jupiter supplies the energy to keep the ocean liquid.

But more <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140919.html">tantalizing</a> is the possibility that even in the
absence of sunlight that process could also supply the energy to support life, <a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/">making Europa</a> one of the best places to look for life beyond Earth.

What kind of life could thrive in a deep, dark, subsurface ocean?
